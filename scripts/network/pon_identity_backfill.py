"""Establish stored structural identity on PON ports. Idempotent.

Migration ``483_pon_structural_identity`` adds the columns and the two partial
unique indexes but deliberately writes no data: resolving identity needs the
platform shape and the identity owner's refusals, which is application logic,
not SQL.

This is that step. It asks ``network.pon_port_identity`` to resolve each row
from its sources — hardware topology on a chassis OLT, the port name on a
single-box one — and writes the answer to ``identity_frame``/``identity_slot``/
``identity_port``. Rows it cannot resolve are left untouched, not cleared: a
transient inability to resolve must never erase an identity already proven.

Because the resolution is the owner's and the write is idempotent, running this
twice is a no-op and running it after hardware topology is corrected repairs the
affected rows.

``--dry-run`` reports exactly what would be written and commits nothing. Run it
first: the partial unique indexes are live, so a backfill is also the moment two
rows claiming one identity would collide, and that collision is a finding rather
than an error to retry past.

Exit codes: ``0`` when every row either resolved or was already correct, ``1``
when any row could not be resolved or a collision was detected.
