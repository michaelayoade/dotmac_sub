"""Pre-merge census for the OLT reconciliation identity/service-port fixes.

Astra audit findings (Bug 1: identity never bound; Bug 2: service ports
compared by index alone) are fixed by binding a found OLT registration's
fsp/onu_id against the desired ``fsp``/``olt_ont_id`` target before treating
it as an observation, and by comparing service ports on vlan_id/gem_index/
ont_id/fsp rather than index alone. Both fixes change reconciler BEHAVIOR
for any ONT that is currently relying on the old, buggy substitutions to
"work" — so before this ships, we need to know how many ONTs are affected
and in what way.

Four counts, each naming a distinct risk:

* ``null_board_or_port`` — ``OntUnit.board``/``.port`` missing, so
  ``desired.fsp`` resolves to ``""``. Under the fix, every such ONT reports
  ``OLT_IDENTITY_UNRESOLVED`` and stops receiving OLT writes until an owner
  fills in board/port.
* ``unparseable_external_id`` — ``parse_ont_id_on_olt(external_id)`` returns
  ``None``. Before the fix this silently became ONT-ID 0 (a real, possibly
  IN-USE id on the OLT); under the fix it is ``OLT_IDENTITY_UNRESOLVED`` —
  the same outcome as the row above, from the other required field.
* ``observed_vlan_gem_mismatch`` — the last-persisted OLT observation has a
  service port sitting at the desired mgmt/wan index with a DIFFERENT
  vlan_id/gem_index. Before the fix this was silently accepted as "already
  correct" (index-only comparison); under the fix it becomes unrepairable
  drift that blocks convergence until a human resolves it (no auto
  delete+recreate).
* ``null_service_port_index`` — ``mgmt_service_port_index``/
  ``wan_service_port_index`` unresolved. Already gated by the existing
  SERVICE_PORT_INDEX_UNALLOCATED refusal (Bug 4, fixed on main before this
  branch); counted here for completeness since it interacts with the same
  service-port code path this PR touches.

This script does not repair anything. It is read-only by construction — one
REPEATABLE READ, READ ONLY snapshot, rolled back rather than committed — and
performs no device I/O. Exit 0 means every active ONT's OLT identity and
persisted service-port evidence is clean; exit 1 means at least one of the
four counts is non-zero and lists the affected rows so an operator can
triage before/after this PR merges.

Usage::

    poetry run python scripts/network/olt_reconcile_identity_census.py

Modeled on ``scripts/network/pon_port_identity_census.py`` — same
read-only-snapshot pattern, same read-report-rollback shape.
