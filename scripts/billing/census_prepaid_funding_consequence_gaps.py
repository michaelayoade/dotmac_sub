"""Read-only census: prepaid funding events awaiting or missing consequence.

Rebuilt (round 2) after the round-1 version was found to produce systematic
false negatives: it checked "does this account have ANY active entitlement"
instead of "does this account have an active entitlement covering THIS
SPECIFIC period," and relied on `EventStore.subscription_id`, which is never
populated at the actual `payment.received`/`account_credit.deposited` emit
sites (`app/services/billing/payments.py`).

Primary source (accurate, exact-period, no reconstruction needed): the
`prepaid_funding_trigger_executions`/`prepaid_funding_trigger_subscription_outcomes`
receipt model and `prepaid_draft_reconciliation_exceptions` review-item
table, both of which now record the exact account/subscription/period a
blocked or ambiguous case concerns (see the funding-consequence
single-owner cutover). Every case going forward is found here with no
derivation required.

Secondary source (best-effort, historical, opt-in via `--include-legacy`):
`EventHandlerAttempt` failures for `PrepaidRenewalHandler` predating the
receipt/review-item model, where the affected period cannot be exactly
reconstructed from the event alone -- reported separately and explicitly
labeled as such, never merged into the accurate primary counts.

Writes nothing.

# A disposition that claims a real settlement happened. Any receipt written
# with one of these MUST carry at least one
# `PrepaidFundingTriggerSubscriptionOutcome` child row -- the exact gap
# Michael found (2026-09, round 7): a `draft_invoice_settled` receipt could
# previously commit with ZERO children, because the existing-draft
# reconciliation branch discarded its own settlement evidence instead of
# reporting it back as a `PrepaidFundingSubscriptionDecision`. Fixed at the
# write site (`app/services/prepaid_service_renewals.py`'s
# `_record_prepaid_funding_trigger_execution`, which now refuses to commit
# this exact shape).
#
# Accuracy correction (2026-09, round 8): this is a hardcoded two-string
# disposition filter, not a disposition-name-independent structural check --
# `find_successful_receipts_missing_child_evidence` only inspects rows whose
# `disposition` is one of these two exact values, so a hypothetical future
# write site that names a THIRD "this succeeded" disposition string is
# invisible to this check until that string is added here too. What IS
# structural about it is narrower: for the two dispositions it does check,
# it inspects the actual child-row count rather than trusting the
# disposition alone.
#
# Known, deliberately un-widened gap: `stage_prepaid_draft_after_funding_
# change`'s `void_duplicate` outcome (`existing_draft_voided`) is never
# reported through `FundingChangeRenewalDisposition.draft_invoice_settled`/
# `funded` on its own -- a void-only funding event (no new renewal follows
# it in the same call) currently produces no receipt at all, so it is
# invisible to BOTH this check and `find_blocked_trigger_executions`. Voiding
# a duplicate is not itself a funding consequence needing review (the
# ORIGINAL invoice it duplicates is what actually got funded), so this is
# likely fine as-is, but it is flagged here honestly rather than silently
# left unmentioned.
