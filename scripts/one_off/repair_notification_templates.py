"""Repair bad notification_templates rows in place.

Background
----------
Three template sources disagreed on placeholder syntax. The standalone seeder
``scripts/seed/seed_notification_templates.py`` wrote rows using DOUBLE-brace
``{{var}}`` plus variables the live renderers never produce (``payment_link``,
``company_name``, ``customer_name``, ``days_overdue``, ``short_link`` ...). The
live event renderer (``events/handlers/notification.py:_render_text``) only
fills SINGLE-brace ``{var}`` and only for variables the render context supplies,
so those rows went out with literal ``{{amount}}`` / blank placeholders and
alarming all-caps debt copy.

This one-off normalizes the STORED rows (the data is the problem, not the
renderer):

* Known billing / collections / device codes are replaced wholesale with
  approved, softened, single-brace copy (``APPROVED`` below).
* Any other row is mechanically normalized: supported ``{{x}}`` -> ``{x}``,
  UNSUPPORTED placeholders are removed (never left blank/literal), and a few
  alarming phrases are softened.

Safe by default: prints a dry-run diff. Pass ``--apply`` to write + commit.

Usage (inside the app container)::

    python scripts/one_off/repair_notification_templates.py            # dry-run
    python scripts/one_off/repair_notification_templates.py --apply    # write
    python scripts/one_off/repair_notification_templates.py --code dunning_notice
