"""Read-only reconciliation pass over every billing discrepancy class.

Companion to ``docs/audits/BILLING_SOT_AUDIT_2026-07-12.md``. This script does
not write. It has no ``--apply`` flag and never commits: the session is rolled
back in a ``finally`` block. Its job is to size each discrepancy class on real
data so the historical-repair scope can be set before any correction is built.

The audit's "possible impact" caveat is the whole point of this tool. Every
finding in the report is a reachable code path; only a query against real data
says whether it actually fired, and how often, and for how much money.

Classes reported
----------------
  D1  ledger double-swing        F1   reversal posted AND original deactivated
  D2  unbacked dead credit       F1   no Payment and no reconciled legacy mirror
  D3  paid-with-balance          F24  invoice paid yet balance_due > 0
  D4  native orphan payments     F19  succeeded native payment, no allocation, no ledger
  D5  misallocated payments      F3   ledger invoice_id != allocation invoice_id
  D6  succeeded, no paid_at      F15  blinds the enforcement health gate
  D7  reconstructed drift        F4   persisted outputs vs independent expected position
  D8  unapplied credit notes     F4   spendable per documents, invisible to the ledger
  D9  pending money              F18  pending payment already holding allocation/ledger
  D10 void with live debits      F6   void bypassed the ledger reversal
  D11 opening debits             --   cutover seed cohort, split by deposit sign
  D12 enforcement mismatch       F6/F7 funded+locked / unfunded+served

Two detectors were WRONG on first contact with real data and were narrowed. Both
mistakes were of the same kind — counting a deliberate design decision as damage:

  D2  counted every deactivated ledger row as a silent balance move. Most of them
      duplicate the Payment/Invoice documents the balance is actually derived
      from, so deactivating them removed a double-count. It now requires both no
      native Payment and no per-account mirror/deposit reconciliation. Gross
      figure was NGN 2.2bn; the part that needs adjudication is far smaller.
  D4  counted splynx-imported payments as orphans. They have no local allocation
      or ledger entry BY DESIGN (mirrored, not posted). Gross was 3,117 payments
      / NGN 146M; the real native signal was 1 payment.

Read every future number here the same way: a cluster being real is not the same
as its cause being real.

Examples
--------
  # PostgreSQL replicas are accepted by default; primaries are refused.
  python -m scripts.one_off.billing_alignment_audit --only D2,D7,D12
  python -m scripts.one_off.billing_alignment_audit --out /tmp/align --limit 0
  # Staging primary only, after the host has been explicitly approved:
  python -m scripts.one_off.billing_alignment_audit --only D1,D3 --allow-primary

Production safety
-----------------
The runner sets the PostgreSQL transaction read-only, applies a per-statement
timeout, refuses primaries by default, derives D7/D12 balances with bounded
whole-table aggregates, and resolves D12 thresholds through the canonical batch
owner. In isolated adjudication mode, D7/D12 require an immutable ``--snapshot-at``
and source tables loaded from retained Splynx backups. ``--allow-primary`` is an
explicit exception, not the normal prod path. Free-text memos are used only
inside the detector and are never written to CSV.

    ``customer_financial_ledger`` actually derives the balance from, so
    deactivating them removed a DOUBLE-COUNT rather than destroying money. On
    staging that benign case was 1,759 of 2,229 accounts.

    The authoritative Splynx cutoff ledger, not the mutable local deposit, owns
    the opening position.  Therefore a deactivated local projection dated before
    native payment activity is harmless when that account has cutoff-ledger
    coverage: the reconstruction does not consume the local projection at all.

    The remaining questions are accounts with no mapped cutoff ledger and
    credits dated after native payment activity began.  Those need independent
    settlement/adjustment provenance; current local balance fields are not
    allowed to validate them.
