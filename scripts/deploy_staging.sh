# Staging-only deployment adapter.
#
# The staging database is non-authoritative and shares its host disk with the
# application stack. A full local pg_dump before every staging deployment can
# therefore starve the running services of I/O without protecting production.
# This adapter proves the exact staging host contract before opting out of that
# local dump. Seabone's cold application imports can exceed the production
# health budget under measured disk/swap pressure, so this adapter also owns a
# ten-minute health window. Production uses its own verified adapter, where
# backups remain enabled by default; it sets the same ten-minute web health
# window for its own measured cold-start reasons.
