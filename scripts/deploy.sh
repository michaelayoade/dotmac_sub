# Deploy dotmac_sub from a registry-built (GHCR) image — no host build.
#
# This is the RECOMMENDED production path: it runs the exact image CI built and
# tested, decoupled from the box's git working tree (which has repeatedly drifted
# — feature branches, dirty trees, hand-applied migrations). `make prod-deploy`
# (host build) is kept only as an air-gapped/registry-down fallback.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy.sh sha-abc1234        deploy this image tag (CI builds one per commit on main)
#   deploy.sh --status           show pinned vs running image
#   SKIP_BACKUP=1 deploy.sh ...  skip the pre-migration DB backup (NOT recommended)
#   HEALTH_CURL_TIMEOUT=N ...    cap each health-check curl attempt at N seconds
#                                (default 5) so a hung health endpoint can't stall
#                                a retry indefinitely
#
# RUN IT DETACHED over SSH -- `nohup ./scripts/deploy.sh sha-... &` or inside
# tmux. A dropped SSH session sends SIGHUP and kills the deploy mid-flight; the
# script now cleans up after itself, but a deploy that dies during `alembic
# upgrade heads` still leaves the schema half-applied.
#
# Procedure:
#   verify image on GHCR -> DB backup -> pull -> verify OCI revision ->
#   pin APP_IMAGE + GIT_SHA in .env ->
#   migrate + verify -> warm candidate -> recreate app+workers -> health gate.
#
# On a failed health gate the previous image is re-pinned and the services are
# recreated on it. Migrations are NOT reverted automatically — new revisions must
# be backward-compatible with the previous release.
