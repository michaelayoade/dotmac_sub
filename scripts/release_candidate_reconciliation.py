"""Reconcile a `candidate-<sha>` tag that may already exist in the registry.

`release-candidate.yml`'s "Refuse duplicate candidate build" step used to be a
pure existence check on the mutable `candidate-<sha>` tag: if the tag was
there, the workflow refused to run again for that commit, forever. That was
correct for the case it was written for (someone re-dispatching a build that
already succeeded) and wrong for the case that actually happened in
production: the build succeeded, pushed the image, and then the immediately
following digest-visibility check failed on a transient GHCR propagation
delay. The tag existed; the run still failed; nothing could ever rerun it
except a human deleting the GHCR package version by hand.

This module is the pure decision the workflow now makes instead. Every field
of a re-derived candidate evidence document -- except which run wrote it -- is
recoverable from the immutable image itself, so a resume needs zero state from
the failed run. Prior evidence, when it can still be found, is used only as a
cross-check constraint, never as the source of the new document.

Two supporting pieces of hardening live here alongside the reconciliation
decision itself:

- `parse_extracted_digest` / `MalformedRegistryDigestError`: a digest string
  read off the registry (or off a downloaded evidence document) is validated
  against the exact `sha256:` + 64-lowercase-hex shape this repository
  already requires everywhere else, and a malformed value fails closed with a
  distinct error naming the raw value -- rather than flowing on into a
  comparison, an evidence write, or an unrelated `docker pull` failure later.
- `RegistryReadOutcome` / `resolve_registry_read` / `classify_registry_inspect_error`:
  the generic, injectable shape of a bounded, classified registry-read retry
  -- FOUND and the definite-negative NOT_FOUND resolve immediately, AMBIGUOUS
  retries up to a budget and then fails closed -- mirroring the tag-existence
  check's own retry loop in `release-candidate.yml` so that shape is
  independently proven correct under simulated registry behavior (GHCR
  propagation delay, transient errors, exhaustion, a genuine absence) without
  needing a live registry.
