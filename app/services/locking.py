"""Pessimistic locking utilities for database concurrency control.

Provides consistent helpers for acquiring row-level locks to prevent
concurrent modifications. Use these when:
- Multiple processes might modify the same row simultaneously
- You need read-modify-write consistency
- Eventual consistency (optimistic locking) is not acceptable

Usage:
    from app.services.locking import lock_for_update, lock_multiple

    # Lock a single entity:
    subscriber = lock_for_update(db, Subscriber, subscriber_id)
    if subscriber is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Not found")
    subscriber.balance += amount
    db.commit()

    # Lock multiple entities (sorted to prevent deadlocks):
    invoices = lock_multiple(db, Invoice, invoice_ids)
    for invoice in invoices:
        invoice.status = InvoiceStatus.paid
    db.commit()

    # Non-blocking lock (fails immediately if locked):
    from app.services.unit_of_work import ConcurrencyConflict
    try:
        subscriber = lock_for_update(db, Subscriber, subscriber_id, nowait=True)
    except ConcurrencyConflict:
        # Handle the conflict (retry, return error, etc.)
        pass
