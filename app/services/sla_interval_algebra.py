"""Half-open interval algebra for SLA period scoring (OUTAGE_SLA_SPINE §4).

Pure functions over immutable spans — no session, no clock, no I/O. Scoring
correctness is almost entirely this arithmetic, so it lives on its own where
it can be exhaustively tested without a database.

Every span is half-open ``[start, end)``. That is not a detail: it is what
lets one interval end exactly where the next begins without the boundary
instant being counted twice or dropped. A closed convention would make
"policy A until 09:00, policy B from 09:00" either double-count or lose the
09:00 instant, and a month of those errors is a wrong customer-facing number.

The operations exist because a period score is a set-algebra problem:

    downtime  = confirmed ∩ eligible          (never outside entitlement)
    unknown   = eligible − monitored          (absence of evidence, explicit)
    uptime    = eligible − downtime − unknown (never assumed)

Overlapping intervals are unioned, never summed: two concurrent incidents on
one subscription are one outage to the customer, and adding them would invent
downtime that did not happen.
