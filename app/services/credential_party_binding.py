"""Canonical credential-to-Party authentication projection owner.

Mechanism and storage are separate vocabularies: a binding declares an open,
owner-declared ``mechanism_code`` while a credential persists a coarse
``AuthProvider``. ``authentication_mechanism_registry`` owns the one mapping
between them, and both the write path and the convergence report below consume
that same declaration rather than comparing the two names literally.

Migration 527 is additive: legacy principal foreign keys remain authoritative
for login until a later reader cutover. This service is the only runtime writer
of the new projection. It binds a credential to a Person Party, one installed
verifier binding, Sub's operator tenant, and reviewed evidence in one command.

The person-only rule is scoped to ``UserCredential.party_id``. A Subscriber may
correctly belong to an Organization Party; its credential instead binds to a
reviewed human administrator. This command never rewrites the Subscriber owner
to satisfy authentication.
