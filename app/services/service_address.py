"""Canonical resolver for a subscriber's service ``Address``.

The single reader path for subscriber service location
(``docs/designs/SUBSCRIBER_SERVICE_LOCATION_SOT.md``). Consumers call this
instead of re-deriving the address or reading the legacy inline
``subscribers.address_*`` columns; it collapses the several near-duplicate
resolvers that grew up across the codebase. The customer/subscriber domain owns
the service ``Address``; this is how everyone else reads it.
