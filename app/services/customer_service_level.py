"""Per-subscription SLA policy resolution and period scoring (shadow phase).

Owner: ``customer.service_level`` (OUTAGE_SLA_SPINE §4). Read-time only in
this slice: it resolves the effective policy (offer-version precedence today;
subscription/account contract tables arrive with cutover), merges the accrual
ledger's qualifying intervals, and scores one Africa/Lagos calendar-month
period. It never invents a contractual SLA — no effective policy renders
measured availability with the ``no_contractual_sla`` verdict, not a 99.5%
default. Overlapping intervals are unioned, never summed; excluded intervals
are reported in their own bucket, never silently dropped; unknown-coverage
tracking and persisted effective-dated policy versions are later slices, so
every score carries ``policy`` + ``evidence_digest`` for lineage and the
existing read-time ``topology.customer_availability`` stays authoritative for
display until the shadow-comparison gate cuts over.
