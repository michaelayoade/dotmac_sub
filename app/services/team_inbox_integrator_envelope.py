"""Envelope -> Sub command normalization for the Integrator messaging port.

Owner: ``communications.team_inbox_integrator_envelope``.

This module is pure. It takes no session, writes nothing, reaches no network,
and holds no state. Everything it produces is a
:class:`~app.services.team_inbox_observations.RecordProviderObservationCommand`
handed to the existing observation owner, which is the only writer of an
``inbox_provider_observations`` row.

## Why the normalization lives on Sub's side of the wire

The Integrator translates a provider's wire format into a provider-neutral
capability envelope. It does not, and must not, know that Sub prefixes a
provider event identity with ``message:``, that Sub's WhatsApp channel is
called ``whatsapp``, or that Sub truncates an account scope to 160 characters.
Those are Sub's conventions for Sub's own columns. If the Integrator encoded
them, every one of Sub's internal renamings would become a cross-repository
breaking change.

So the envelope carries the provider's facts and Sub converts them using the
*same* conventions its own receiver uses. That is what makes an Integrator-fed
observation and a webhook-fed observation land on one identity — which is in
turn what makes the producer-overlap window safe (see
``docs/INTEGRATOR_MESSAGING_RECEIVE_CUTOVER.md``).

## `provider` names the provider, never the transport

A WhatsApp message that reached Sub through the Integrator is still a
``meta_cloud_api`` observation. Recording it under an ``integrator`` provider
would do two harmful things at once: it would let a transport masquerade as a
provider in the domain identity, and it would give the same upstream event two
different identities either side of a cutover, so every message in flight would
be recorded twice. Which transport carried it is provenance, and provenance
lives on the ``integration_inbox`` receipt — a row that already names the
binding, the installation and therefore the Integrator.

## Two different fingerprints, deliberately

``payload_fingerprint`` on the envelope is the **transport** fingerprint: a
canonical-JSON SHA-256 over the observation body as the Integrator serialized
it, recomputed here so a body mangled in transit is refused rather than
recorded. Sub's **domain** fingerprint is computed inside
``team_inbox_observations._fingerprint`` over the whole normalized command and
is what arbitrates replay against collision. They answer different questions
and neither substitutes for the other.
