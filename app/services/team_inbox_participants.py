"""Which endpoints took part in a conversation.

Shadow projection over observed message headers. It records *that* an endpoint
participated and how it was admitted; it does not decide who the endpoint
belongs to, and nothing reads it for a threading or export decision yet.

Two separations are load-bearing:

- **Endpoint before party.** ``party_contact_point_id`` is nullable. Inbox owns
  participation; ``party.registry`` owns identity. Requiring the binding would
  make an unknown colleague or an unreviewed address unrepresentable.
- **Admission source before relationship.** How an endpoint arrived (``From``,
  ``Cc``, operator) is evidence and never changes. What it turns out to be
  (customer, contact, third party) is a classification that Party may revise
  later. Collapsing them would let a reclassification rewrite history.
