"""``service_intent.offer_access_requirement`` — the sole owner of:

- access-classified offer-version admission
- the immutable access requirement for an exact offer version
- reviewed classification of legacy/unclassified versions

Release 1 only. Release 2 (rejecting ``unclassified`` at admission and
dropping the DB default) is separate, later work — see
``docs/designs/CATALOG_ACCESS_REQUIREMENT_AUTHORITY.md``.

``service_intent.catalog_policy`` (``app/services/catalog/policies.py``) is a
deliberately separate, untouched owner. This module never imports it and
never reads/writes its tables.

Both public commands (admission and reviewed classification) enter through
``execute_owner_command`` and perform their own persistence and transaction
completion here — a caller builds the command and reads the result; it never
constructs the ``OfferVersion`` row or the classification row itself.

Authorization for admission has ONE owner: ``authorize_offer_version_
admission``, below. It decides the WHOLE question — the compound
``catalog:write AND (catalog:billing_write OR catalog:offer_version:
admission)`` permission rule, AND the ERP staff leave-write restriction
(``app/services/erp_staff_access.py``) — never just the leaf permission
grant. TWO call sites DELEGATE to this one owner rather than each deciding
independently: ``app/api/catalog.py``'s route dependency
(``_require_offer_version_admission``), and this module's own
``verify_admission_authorization``, called from ``_admit`` inside the same
transaction as the write, re-verifying against the live database for
whichever principal was supplied (never a trusted caller-supplied flag).
Because both delegate to the same function, there is exactly one decision
to get right, not two independently-maintained approximations of one rule
that can silently disagree (the earlier shape — the route composing
``require_any_permission`` while the command called a bare permission
primitive — refused an active staff leave restriction over HTTP while
allowing it through the command directly; that class of drift is now
structurally impossible, not merely tested against).
``AdmitOfferVersionCommand.principal`` remains the audit/attribution
identity as well, but it is no longer unchecked evidence. Classification has
no pre-authorizing route (its only caller is a trust-the-operator CLI); its
permission is re-verified fresh, inside this module, immediately before the
write.

    the auth dict (both currently surface as ``principal_type == "api_key"``
    at the HTTP layer for backward compatibility — see
    ``app/api/catalog.py``'s ``_admission_principal``).

    THIS IS THE EXACT, NON-GROWING COMPATIBILITY PATH for machine-credential
    admission, and — per Michael's ruling — SHADOW MODE IS ITS TERMINAL
    STATE on this branch, not a staging step toward a flag flip. A
    cross-repository census established that the published Kernel
    (``dotmac-kernel==0.1.0a94``, Sub's actual pin) cannot supply what real
    enforcement would need: the ``MachinePrincipal`` it returns carries
    ``credential_id``/``tenant_id``/``label``/``scopes``, but no
    ``application`` field (at this pin) and no expiry/revocation evidence
    on the principal at all (checked inside ``authenticate_machine``, but
    not surfaced) — Sub would have to reinterpret raw authentication facts
    Kernel owns to fill that gap, which is exactly the wrong place for that
    decision to live. Enforcement here waits for a Kernel successor that
    publishes a verified machine principal carrying identity, kind,
    attribution, effective leaf scopes, expiry, and revocation evidence
    (recorded in Knowledge:
    ``dotmac-kernel-verified-machine-authentication-successor-contract``).
    Until that contract exists and is adopted, ``authorize_offer_version_
    admission`` runs this principal's authorization decision in SHADOW /
    WOULD-REFUSE mode only: it computes and logs whether the compound rule
    would have refused, using the scopes captured at authentication time
    (below), but never raises — admission proceeds regardless, identical
    to every machine credential's behavior before this module had any
    command-level check at all. This is the ONE and ONLY principal type
    this module treats this way: the ``credential_kind == "machine"``
    branch in ``authorize_offer_version_admission`` names exactly this
    case, and
    ``test_machine_credential_is_the_only_shadow_mode_principal`` fails the
    build if that set ever silently grows to cover another principal type.

    ``scopes`` is a SNAPSHOT taken at authentication time, not a live
    re-read — this module has no live query surface into the kernel's
    credential/scope storage, and building one to work around the missing
    contract is exactly the workaround this ruling forbids. A scope revoked
    between authentication and this command's transaction is not observed
    by this snapshot; that gap stays open until the successor contract
    lands, not something this module can safely close on its own.

    both DELEGATE to this ONE function rather than each independently
    deciding — there is exactly one decision, so there is nothing for the
    two call sites to disagree about, and no name-matching guard is needed
    to keep them "in sync": there is only one implementation to keep at all.
    An active staff leave restriction (account active, roles/grants intact,
    writes refused) is refused here exactly as it is over HTTP — a
    caller reaching this command directly must not get a MORE permissive
    answer than the route would have given the identical principal.

    ONLY GATE ON THE HTTP PATH TOO (round 12 finding 2 fix): the offer-
    version admission routes are mounted on ``app/api/catalog.py``'s
    ``admission_router``, which deliberately carries NO blanket router-level
    dependency — unlike this file's other catalog routes, which sit under a
    pre-existing, admission-unrelated ``catalog:write`` gate
    (``require_method_permission``) whose own ``require_permission``
    independently applies the identical ``erp_staff_access.staff_write_
    restricted`` check via older, separate plumbing (a bare-string
    HTTPException detail, and an inline-committed audit write). That older
    check cannot produce a DIFFERENT verdict from this one (both call the
    same underlying primitive) and never runs ahead of this function for
    these two routes specifically, because they are exempt from that
    blanket gate — this function is the one and only decision-maker for
    both the route and a caller who reaches ``admit_offer_version``
    directly (a background job, CLI, or other non-route caller, which
    bypasses the router entirely regardless).

    THIS FUNCTION NEVER COMMITS AND NEVER WRITES AUDIT EVIDENCE ITSELF
    (round 13 correction of an earlier, wrong fix): an in-transaction
    ``db.commit()`` here, when called from ``verify_admission_authorization``
    inside ``execute_owner_command``'s owned transaction, is rejected by
    that boundary's own ``before_commit`` guard
    (``_reject_helper_commit`` in ``app/services/owner_commands.py``) —
    "only the public command boundary may commit its transaction" — so the
    caller got ``OwnerCommandError(nested_transaction_completion)`` instead
    of ``permission_denied``, and the staged audit row was rolled back
    anyway. The fix was worse than the bug it targeted.

    Michael's ruling: a denial rolls back NORMALLY, like any other refusal.
    When the refusal is specifically a staff-leave restriction, this
    function attaches everything needed to reconstruct the audit evidence
    onto the raised error's ``details`` (``leave_restricted=True``, the
    principal identity, and the restriction's own two fields) — it does
    NOT write anything. The OUTER command boundary
    (``admit_offer_version``) and the route adapter
    (``app/api/catalog.py``'s ``_require_offer_version_admission``) each
    call ``record_leave_denial_evidence`` AFTER the denial has already
    unwound in their own transaction, through a genuinely separate one. A
    failure recording that evidence is logged and swallowed — it must
    never mask or replace the ``permission_denied`` the caller already has.

    MACHINE CREDENTIALS ARE SHADOW-ONLY (round 13 finding 2 fix):
    ``claims.credential_kind == "machine"`` routes to
    ``_shadow_check_machine_credential_admission`` — evaluate, log, NEVER
    raise — instead of the enforced check below, for BOTH callers
    identically. This must be checked BEFORE the compound-permission
    enforcement, not after: a valid kernel machine credential without the
    newer, narrower admission scopes must still succeed all the way
    through, not get refused here and never reach the shadow path at all
    (which is exactly what happened when the route built claims with no
    ``credential_kind`` and the typed ``MachineCredentialPrincipal`` was
    only constructed AFTER this dependency had already succeeded or
    failed).

    """SHADOW / WOULD-REFUSE evaluation for a machine-credential admission —
    evaluates and LOGS what the compound rule would have decided; NEVER
    raises, and NEVER refuses, no matter what. This is the TERMINAL state
    for a machine credential on this branch, not a staging step (see
    ``MachineCredentialPrincipal``'s own docstring for the full ruling):
    the published Kernel Sub actually depends on cannot yet supply a
    verified machine principal carrying the identity, attribution, scope,
    expiry, and revocation evidence real enforcement would require, so a
    machine credential that ``origin/main`` authorized must still succeed
    here — hard-enforcing today, with what this module can actually see,
    would be an uncensused, silent access retirement.

    TWO PROPERTIES this function is held to, both round-14 corrections of
    the earlier shape:

    1. NEVER RAISES. The earlier version called the DB-backed
       ``_admission_permission_granted``/``has_permission``, so an RBAC
       query error or statement timeout escaped as an unhandled exception
       — a 500 in front of admission, which directly contradicts "evaluate
       and log, never raise." Everything below is wrapped so no exception
       from the evaluation itself can ever propagate.
    2. READS ONLY THE CAPTURED SNAPSHOT, never a live authority table.
       ``_admission_permission_granted`` also takes the ``principal_type
       == "api_key"`` branch of ``has_permission``, which — for anything
       NOT ``"system_user"`` — queries ``SubscriberRole``/
       ``SubscriberPermission`` keyed by ``principal_id``. A machine
       credential's UUID coincidentally matching (or a wildcard grant
       existing for) an unrelated subscriber row could make this shadow
       diagnostic report "authorized" for a credential whose ACTUAL
       captured scopes authorize nothing — a diagnostic that can lie is
       worse than one that is silent. The check below is pure in-memory
       set membership against ``claims.scopes`` (via
       ``auth_dependencies._expand_permission_keys``, the SAME
       alias/wildcard-expansion primitive ``has_permission`` itself uses
       for its own scope-intersection shortcut — not a second, differently
       -written expansion), and touches no database table at all.

    Works ONLY from what this module can actually see: ``claims.scopes``,
    the snapshot captured at authentication time
    (``auth_dependencies._machine_principal``, via its ``credential_kind``
    stamp) and threaded through by BOTH callers — the route
    (``app/api/catalog.py``'s ``_require_offer_version_admission``, from
    the live HTTP auth dict) and the command
    (``verify_admission_authorization``, from the typed
    ``MachineCredentialPrincipal``). This module has no live query surface
    into the kernel's own credential/scope storage, and building one to
    work around the missing successor contract is exactly the workaround
    Michael's ruling forbids — the logged decision is necessarily a
    point-in-time approximation, a diagnostic/inventory aid, never a live
    re-verification.

    reaches this directly (bypassing the route) is held to the IDENTICAL
    decision, made by the SAME owner function

    underscore-prefixed) because ``_admit`` (admission), ``OfferVersions.
    update`` (PATCH — every other field mutation of an already-admitted
    row), and ``OfferVersions.delete`` (deactivation) all call it (``app/
    services/catalog/offers.py``) — this is the ONE reusable live-claims
    rebuild + owner delegation, not several separately maintained copies of
    the same per-principal-type resolution. Not every mutation in this
    module is covered by this list — only these three call it today; a new
    mutation of an already-admitted offer version must call it too, not be
    assumed to inherit the property.

    ``SystemAdmission`` is exempt — see its own docstring; it carries no
    RBAC identity to check.

    Called TWICE from ``_admit``: once immediately after the advisory locks
    are acquired (before any existence check), and again immediately before
    the ``OfferVersion`` INSERT, narrowing the window between a permission
    read and the write it gates — the same two-checkpoint discipline
    ``_classify`` already uses. ``OfferVersions.update`` calls it ONCE,
    immediately before its own mutation (see that function for why a
    single check suffices there).

    RESIDUAL PREMISE, stated precisely rather than left implicit: neither
    caller locks the principal's own authorization state
    (``system_users``/``roles``/``role_permissions``/``permissions``/
    ``subscriber_roles``/``subscriber_permissions``/``api_keys`` rows) —
    admission's advisory locks only serialize concurrent admissions of the
    SAME idempotency key or (offer_id, version_number) target, and an
    update holds no lock of its own kind at all. A revoke of the exact
    grant that made THIS check pass, committed by another transaction in
    the narrow window between this check and the caller's own commit, is
    not observed — the write still proceeds and persists under what is, by
    the time it lands, already-revoked authority. This is the identical
    class of residual window ``_classify`` documents and accepts for the
    same reason: closing it fully would require row-locking the entire
    RBAC surface (six-plus tables, several of them shared by every other
    authorization check in the system) for the duration of every admission
    or update, which is judged disproportionate given that the acting
    principal is recorded (audit/attribution — never anonymous) and the
    resulting row is ordinary, visible, correctable data: an operator can
    deactivate or correct it through the existing offer-version
    admin/repair paths like any other wrongly-mutated row, it is not a
    silent or unrecoverable state. The window is one commit wide, not
