"""Ops queue for unmatched/ambiguous customer radios (internal tickets).

Truly-unmatched radios must become work items in a queue someone already
works — the internal support-ticket table — not a dashboard list. Creation is
delegated to the canonical Ticket lifecycle participant so every item receives
a human-readable number plus audit/event evidence. The typed silent-internal
mode suppresses assignment, SLA, automation, and notification consequences.

Semantics:
- Dedupe: at most ONE open item per radio MAC (``metadata.radio_mac``,
  bare lowercase hex). Re-detections bump ``metadata.occurrences`` instead of
  spawning new tickets.
- Auto-close: the hourly review (``evaluate``) resolves an item as soon as
  the radio becomes matched (a UISP-confirmed ``cpe_devices`` row exists for
  the MAC) or, for conflict items, once the MAC no longer maps to more than
  one subscriber.
- Sources:
  1. validation-time conflicts from radio registration
     (app/services/radio_registration.py),
  2. radios registered at install that the UISP sync has NOT confirmed after
     a grace period (the radio never appeared in UISP, or the recorded MAC is
     wrong), and
  3. the uisp_sync per-station hook (``_enqueue_station_review``): stations
     UISP reports that resolve to no subscriber (``REASON_UISP_UNMATCHED``),
     to more than one candidate (``REASON_CONFLICT``), or whose serving AP
     matches no topology node (``REASON_AP_UNRESOLVED``).

``evaluate`` also retires manual placeholder rows superseded by a
UISP-confirmed row for the same MAC + subscriber, so the transient duplicate
created before the uisp_sync adoption hook lands cleans itself up.
