"""Guarded administrative recovery billing for suspended prepaid services.

This owner deliberately creates a *draft* renewal invoice.  It never voids an
existing invoice, spends a generic displayed balance, or resumes access.  The
separate settlement command only spends confirmed unallocated payment credit
when it can settle the exact draft in full; it then derives the entitlement and
asks financial-access resolution to clear only eligible locks.
