"""Customer self-service account deletion (soft-delete).

A subscriber can delete their account from within the app (App Store Guideline
5.1.1(v) / Play Data safety). DotMac is an ISP with active service, billing, and
statutory tax-record retention, so this is a **soft-delete**: the subscriber's
status is set to ``canceled`` (the documented "terminated / soft-deleted, record
preserved" state). That immediately blocks login (``web_customer_auth`` treats
canceled accounts as gone), so the account is deleted from the customer's side,
while the row and billing/tax records are preserved for the retention period;
operations then purge personal data per the privacy policy. The client signs the
user out after a successful request.
