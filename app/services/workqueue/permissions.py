"""Workqueue principals, audience resolution and per-action authorization.

Sub's auth layer hands services a plain ``auth`` dict (principal_id, roles,
scopes). The workqueue turns that into a :class:`WorkqueuePrincipal` once, up
front, so providers and the aggregator never re-query the RBAC tables per item.

Permission keys are deliberately reused from the support domain (the workqueue
is a *view* over tickets/conversations/work orders — it grants no new access),
so no new RBAC seed rows are required.
