"""Sub's `SecretSource` — OpenBao, read once at startup.

ADR-0009 (`dotmac_starter_mt`): **a secret is held, never dereferenced.** Nothing
on a settings resolution path reaches a network, and a value that cannot be held
is not a setting. Material that lives in a secret store is read by the PRODUCT
and installed at boot; the kernel ships no client and never fetches.

This is that product half, over the OpenBao client Sub already has.

## Why these five

Per the classification ruled on 2026-08-09, five specs stop being settings:

* `auth/credential_encryption_key`
* `auth/totp_encryption_key`
* `network/wireguard_key_encryption_key`

  Each encrypts data **in this same database**. Holding them as settings — even
  encrypted at rest — would put the key inside the store it protects, secured by
  another key facing the identical question. Sub's existing `bao://` handling for
  these is already correct; this moves *where the code looks*, not where the
  secret lives.

* `auth/jwt_secret`
* `radius/auth_shared_secret`

  Dotmac issues and rotates both, and both are boot-stable, so holding them in
  memory costs nothing on the read path and keeps rotation central.

The other seven (`smtp_password`, the geocoding keys, `meta_app_secret`, the
vLLM keys, `voice_transcription_api_key`) are third-party credentials Sub holds
a COPY of. Those become real settings encrypted at rest — a settings row gives
history, an actor and an admin surface that a vault path does not.

## Failure behaviour is the whole contract

`load` RAISES when OpenBao is unreachable. It must never return a partial or
empty mapping for that case: empty is indistinguishable from "nothing is
configured", and the kernel would install it as a successful load. So this uses
`resolve_openbao_ref`, which raises, and NOT `get_secret`, which swallows every
exception and returns a default — convenient for a caller with a fallback,
catastrophic for a source whose silence the kernel would trust.

`install_secret_source` then fails the boot rather than starting with secrets it
could not fetch. That is deliberate: a process that starts without them would
discover it at the first request that needed one.

#: Material that is held the same way but whose ABSENCE is a legitimate state,

#: The required set above is all-or-nothing on purpose: those five are needed by
#: every process, so a partial load is a reason to stop. These are needed by ONE
#: feature, and a deployment that does not use that feature has nothing to
#: provision. Failing every boot over a dormant feature's material would be a
#: worse answer than the feature reporting itself unconfigured when asked.
#:
#: The distinction is still the strict one: a MISSING path means not
#: provisioned; an unreachable store, a bad token or a missing field on a path
#: that does exist all still raise — see `secrets.resolve_openbao_ref_optional`.

#: **`prepaid_attestation_public_key`** — the trust anchor

#: is a PUBLIC key, so it needs no confidentiality; what it needs is that only
#: someone with OpenBao access can replace it, because replacing it means
#: forged manifests verify. It used to be a settings row holding a `bao://`
#: reference, which looked like that protection and was not: the guard checked
#: that the value WAS a reference, never WHICH reference, so anyone who could
#: write settings could repoint it at a key they controlled. Holding it puts
#: the path in code, where the settings surface cannot reach it at all.
