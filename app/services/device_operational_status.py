"""Binary device-operation resolver owned by ``network.device_state``.

Collectors write timestamped observations. Their age is an internal lifecycle
input that makes another verification due; it is not a third device state and
must never leak into UI filters, badges, or KPIs.

The public projection therefore has exactly two values:

``working``
    Current verification proves operation, including operation with a separate
    impairment/alarm.

``not_working``
    Verification proves failure or the permanent verification lifecycle cannot
    currently confirm operation. ``reason`` distinguishes physical negative
    evidence from a verifier/path failure without inventing a freshness state.

Administrative maintenance/decommissioning remains separate source state. It
prevents alarms, but the operational answer is still ``not_working``.
