"""Channel and queue health observations (docs/designs/CHANNEL_OBSERVABILITY.md).

Produces the two worker-side snapshots that the dead-man's-switch and the
queue-depth alerts read: per-channel inbound freshness and per-queue depth.
Both are pure reads published through the shared observability snapshot bridge,
so the web process can export them without the worker's in-memory gauges (which
it never sees). Every read is fail-soft: a broker hiccup must not stop the
freshness snapshot, and neither snapshot may ever raise into the beat task.
