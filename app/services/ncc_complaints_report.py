"""NCC Quarterly Complaints return (①) — built from sub's native tickets.

Re-homed from CRM for the CRM exit. The record shape, cleaners and reference
vocabulary are shared with :mod:`app.services.ncc_workbook`, so the JSON the
pack renders and the XLSX the officer files always agree.

Four deliberate divergences from CRM's implementation, each removing a value
we could not honestly source:

1. **Category/sub-category are read, not guessed.** CRM keyword-matched free
   text at report time. Here the classification is derived on save and stored
   on the ticket (:mod:`app.services.ncc_categorisation`), so an agent can
   correct it and the correction is what gets filed. A ticket with no stored
   category reports blank — visible as ``[FAIL]`` at export — rather than
   being silently re-guessed.
2. **Status: Resolved = resolved OR closed.** CRM mapped ``closed`` only, so a
   sub ticket sitting in ``resolved`` would have filed as *Pending* —
   understating our resolution rate. ``canceled``/``merged`` are excluded
   entirely: they are not complaints.
3. **SLA: unknown is blank, not a breach.** CRM returned ``"No"`` when
   ``due_at`` was NULL, reporting an SLA breach that may never have happened.
   A missing due date means we do not know, and the return says so.
4. **Location is never invented.** CRM tried nine address sources and defaulted
   anything unmatched to "Municipal Area Council, FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY" —
   an unlocatable complainant became an Abuja statistic. Here State/LGA/Town
   come from what we actually hold, canonicalised against
   :mod:`app.services.ncc_location`'s reference tables; unresolvable stays
   blank.

Known gaps, reported blank rather than fabricated: sub has no ``Person``
model, so **alt phone** has no source at all (subscribers carry one phone),
and **Age/Gender** exist only for subscriber-linked complaints.
