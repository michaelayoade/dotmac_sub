"""The one service that decides whether we may contact someone.

**Owner of:** "may we send `<category>` to `<address>` on `<channel>`?"

Before this, that question had no owner. Marketing eligibility was decided inside
the campaign segment filter (``comms_campaigns._segment_query``), where opting in
was an *optional checkbox*, and there was no unsubscribe ledger at all. So the
answer depended on who was asking, and a customer who unsubscribed from one
sender stayed reachable by every other.

Every sender now asks this module, and it reads one table
(``communication_suppressions``).

THE DISTINCTION THAT MATTERS
----------------------------
Marketing consent and transactional consent are **not** the same thing, and
collapsing them turns a consent ledger into a billing incident.

An unsubscribe is a refusal of *marketing*. It is not permission to stop sending
someone their invoice, their outage notice, or their service credentials -- we
have a contractual and regulatory duty to send those, and a customer who clicks
"unsubscribe" on a promo has not waived it.

So a suppression carries a scope:

* ``marketing`` -- blocks marketing only. This is what unsubscribe sets.
* ``all``       -- blocks everything, transactional included. Reserved for
                   addresses we genuinely must not send to: hard bounces, spam
                   complaints, legal erasure. **Never** set by a customer
                   clicking unsubscribe.

Every category the platform sends today (billing, account, service, connectivity,
credentials, device, fup, usage, olt, infrastructure) is transactional. Marketing
is the new thing campaigns introduce, so the default for an unknown category is
*transactional* -- fail towards delivering the invoice, not towards silence.
