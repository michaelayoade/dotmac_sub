"""`billing.rating` — deterministic obligation rating (ADR 0007 Phase 2).

A read-only policy/resolver. Given one effective contract version, one of its
lines, and one exact service period, it returns the typed rated result the
obligation owner records: net, tax, and gross per currency, with the inputs
that produced them.

Rules straight from ADR 0007:

- rating is deterministic: the same version, line, period, coverage, and tax
  inputs always produce the same typed result;
- the rate unit is independent of the invoice interval, so a per-day rate can
  aggregate into one calendar-month obligation;
- proration uses the version's declared policy, never an implicit choice;
- tax comes from ``financial.tax_configuration`` records named by the line or
  version treatment code — a missing named code fails closed rather than
  silently rating tax-free;
- no session writes, no transaction completion, no side effects.
