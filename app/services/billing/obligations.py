"""`billing.obligations` — finite billable units (ADR 0007 Phase 1).

An obligation is the finite billable unit for one contract line, charge
component, source fact, period, and currency. It is not an invoice, a payment,
or an entitlement, and its state is never inferred from an invoice label or a
payment origin string.

Its natural identity is enforced in the database, so replay and concurrency
produce one obligation rather than a duplicate charge:

    contract line + contract version + charge component
      + source fact/version + period start + period end + currency

Phase 1 writes obligations in shadow beside current invoice and renewal
behavior. Authority is read from this owner's declared manifest migration
state, so nothing here can be promoted by a runtime flag.
