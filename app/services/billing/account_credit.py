"""Canonical application owner for evidenced subscriber account credit.

Account credit is not a wallet counter. It is the unconsumed portion of exact,

eligible invoices and source payments deterministically, and composes the
existing payment-allocation preview/confirmation owner for every transfer.
It never creates payments or ledger entries directly and never commits.
