"""Read OLT hardware topology out of a Huawei running configuration.

The estate holds 5 shelves, 3 cards and 23 card ports for seven OLTs, so
``PonPort.olt_card_port_id`` is set on 23 of 502 rows and structural identity is
underivable for the rest. The topology was never recorded; it exists only on the
devices. This module reads it back out of a running config, which the fleet
already archives, so the common case needs no device I/O at all.

Two grammar facts drive the parse, both verified against production configs:

* ``interface gpon <frame>/<slot>`` is the authority for frame and slot.
  ``board add <frame>/<slot> <type>`` is *not* sufficient on its own -- the BOI
  config declares ``interface gpon 0/1`` with no matching ``board add`` line --
  so boards are collected for their type but frames and slots come from the
  interface blocks.
* ``ont add <port> <ont_id> sn-auth "<serial>"`` carries **no** F/S/P. Frame and
  slot come from the enclosing interface block; the line supplies the port and
  ONT id. Parsing these lines outside their block context yields a port number
  attached to nothing, which is the same class of mistake as ``pon-{port}``.

Ports are therefore a *lower bound*: a port only appears here if an ONT was
added to it. An empty port is real hardware this parse cannot see, so callers
must treat the result as evidence of what exists, never as proof of what does
not.

Pure and offline by construction: text in, typed records out, no database and no
network. That keeps the grammar testable against captured fixtures and keeps the
import decision separate from the reading of it.
