"""Row-level locking for reconcile passes.

A reconcile holds ``SELECT FOR UPDATE`` on the ``OntUnit`` row for its entire
duration. Two callers reconciling the same ONT serialize on the row lock; on
PostgreSQL this is correct and atomic. (Under sqlite — used in tests —
``FOR UPDATE`` is a no-op but the session is still single-writer, which is
fine for the unit tests; concurrency behavior is exercised in production.)

The lock context manager also detects a crashed prior reconcile. The invariant
is:

    A successful reconcile commits ``sync_status`` to either ``synced`` or
    ``out_of_sync`` before exiting the locked transaction. If the row is found
    with ``sync_status='reconciling'`` at acquisition time, the prior process
    must have died — because if it were still running, it would still hold the
    lock and our SELECT FOR UPDATE would be blocked.

In that case the lock entry-point flips the status to ``out_of_sync`` with a
"prior reconcile did not finalise" note, then yields the row to the new
reconcile so it can attempt its own pass.

Transaction lifecycle is the caller's responsibility — ``reconcile_ont``
commits when it sets the final ``sync_status``. The lock module just provides
the row-locking primitive and the crash-recovery check; it does not call
``commit`` or ``rollback`` itself.

    Behavior:

    * If the row doesn't exist, raises :class:`OntNotFound`.
    * If ``nowait=True`` and the row is already locked by another transaction,
      raises :class:`LockConflict` immediately (no waiting).
    * Otherwise blocks until the lock is acquired.
    * Once locked, if ``sync_status`` is found at ``reconciling`` (a crashed
      prior pass), the status is flipped to ``out_of_sync`` with a crash note
      inside the same transaction. The current reconcile then proceeds.
    * The row is yielded to the caller, which is responsible for mutating
      ``sync_status`` to ``synced`` or ``out_of_sync`` before exiting and for
      committing/rolling back its own transaction.

    The lock is held for the duration of the surrounding transaction. Callers
    must ``commit`` or ``rollback`` to release it.

    Sweeper mode (no proposed_change) uses the same lock; ``mode``-specific
    blocking semantics (e.g. refusing sync writes against an ``out_of_sync``
    ONT) live in ``reconcile_ont`` itself.
