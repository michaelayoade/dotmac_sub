"""Project accepted vendor as-built evidence into fiber plant.

Vendors draw what they actually built and staff accept it, but the accepted
geometry never reached the network record: ``as_built_routes`` was referenced
only by vendor services, so an accepted as-built proved a payment was due and
left the fiber map unchanged. ``AsBuiltRoute.fiber_segment_id`` — a real FK to
``fiber_segments`` — has existed all along with nothing writing it.

Ownership shape (source-of-truth standard):

* ``operations.vendor_project_records`` owns the as-built evidence and its
  review state. That stays authoritative and is never written here.
* This reconciler owns exactly one derived thing: the ``FiberSegment``
  projection of an accepted as-built, and the ``fiber_segment_id`` link that
  binds them.

Because the evidence is authoritative and the segment is derived, a lost or
corrupted segment is repairable: ``reconcile_accepted_as_builts`` rebuilds from
the accepted rows alone. The projection is never the only copy of the truth.

**Built is not the same as operational.** ``fiber_segments`` enforces that an
active segment has both endpoints bound and distinct, which is the schema
stating that a cable nobody has spliced into anything is not yet part of the
network. So the projection creates the segment ``is_active=False``: the cable
exists, its route is recorded, and it is bound to the evidence that proves it
was built — but connecting it into the graph is a staff decision, not something
a vendor's drawing may infer.

**Activation is a separate, explicit command.** ``project_accepted_as_built``
still refuses to invent endpoints, but leaving the projected row inactive
forever made every accepted as-built invisible: every fiber map and plant read
filters ``is_active``, and nothing in the system ever set it. So this module
also owns ``activate_projected_segment`` — the one command that turns *its own*
projected row into operational plant, once an operator states which two
terminations the cable actually landed on.

It is deliberately not a general-purpose "activate a fiber segment" switch:

* it only ever resolves a segment through the ``fiber_segment_id`` backlink of
  an **accepted** as-built, so a segment created by any other owner cannot be
  activated here;
* the operational shape is never satisfied by defaulting. Geometry must already
  be present, and the fiber count comes from the accepted evidence — the
  operator may supply one only when the evidence carries none, and may never
  contradict it;
* endpoint identity, rootedness, and exact core inventory stay with
  ``network.fiber_plant_integrity``. This command binds the endpoints the
  operator names and then submits the result to that validator, so activating
  from an as-built is held to exactly the same operational invariants as a
  reviewed fiber change. It never re-implements them.

What it deliberately does not do:

* It never *retires* plant. A rejected or superseded as-built leaves any
  segment it already produced in place, because removing cable from the network
  record is an operational decision with consequences this reconciler cannot
  see (traces, splices, customer paths).
* It never deactivates a segment, and never re-binds endpoints on a segment
  that is already active — a replayed activation returns the row unchanged.
* It never *infers* endpoints. The projection binds none, and the activation
  command binds only the two an operator explicitly named.
