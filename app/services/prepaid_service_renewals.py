    ``financial.prepaid_service_renewals`` is the sole owner of billing-anchor
    advancement. Payment allocation, invoice application, and draft
    reconciliation are participants: they commit exact entitlement evidence and
    then ask this owner to project it. They never write ``next_billing_at``
    themselves, so there is exactly one writer for the projection.

    The result is a pure function of current coverage state and the caller's
    declared authority, which makes it idempotent under replay:

    ``coverage`` is the union of active ``ServiceEntitlement`` intervals and
    applied ``ServiceExtensionEntry`` grant intervals — exactly what
    ``financial.prepaid_service_coverage`` treats as evidence. The anchor never
    lands below that union, and never below the start of the period this
    invoice funded.

    On top of that floor, ``authority`` decides one question: may the anchor
    move BACKWARDS past an unexplained lead?

    * ``funding_observation`` — no. A payment settling is an observation that
      funding changed; it carries no statement about why the anchor is ahead.
      That lead may be a ``financial.service_extensions`` grant, a
      ``financial.subscription_billing_grants`` grant, or the extension delta
      the payment owner deliberately preserved in the same transaction while
      re-anchoring a lapsed renewal. Overwriting it would silently claw back
      service another owner granted, so advancement is monotonic while this
      invoice's own entitlements survive.
    * ``reviewed_reconciliation`` — yes. A named owner has just rewritten this
      invoice's documentary period from an operator-confirmed, fingerprint-
      bound preview and holds exact entitlement evidence for it. A stale anchor
      left behind by a long-lapsed period carries no grant, and is precisely
      what ``financial.prepaid_service_coverage`` classifies as an unresolved
      projection: never restoration or suspension authority. A reviewed
      correction may resolve it downwards. This stays sound because the floor
      above still applies — reviewed authority can only pull the anchor down
      ONTO existing coverage, never below it, so it can delete an evidence-free
      lead but can never cancel granted service.

    Retraction after a refund, chargeback, reversal, or reallocation needs no
    special authority: once this invoice's entitlements are revoked they leave
    the coverage union, and the anchor follows the evidence down on its own.
