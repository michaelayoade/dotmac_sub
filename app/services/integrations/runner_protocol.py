"""Versioned wire contract between Sub and an out-of-process connector runner.

Phase 2 of ADR 0004. This module defines *what crosses the boundary*, not how
it is transported: Phase 3 marshals these models over a concrete channel, and
the same schema is what a third-party connector image implements.

Three properties are deliberate and are enforced by tests rather than asserted.

**Secret material is not on the wire.** ``RunnerRequest`` has no field for it.
An external runner receives credentials out of band for exactly one
installation binding, so secret values cannot leak into a request that is
otherwise safe to log, persist as delivery evidence, or replay. The design
requires that secret values never enter the operation payload, task arguments,
logs, traces, audit rows, or runner artifacts.

**The connector is pinned, not named.** Every request carries the connector
key, version, and sha256 manifest digest. A runner that receives a digest it
was not built for must refuse rather than best-effort interpret the payload.

**Refusal is typed.** A runner answers every verb with a ``RunnerResponse``.
Transport failure is the caller's concern; a runner that reached a decision
reports it in-band so the caller can distinguish "the connector rejected this"
from "the connector never ran".
