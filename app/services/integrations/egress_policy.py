"""Egress allowlist an external connector is confined to.

Phase 4 of ADR 0004. A connector manifest declares the hosts it may reach
(``EgressManifest``). Those hosts are validated at install time but, before
this, were enforced nowhere at runtime: a running connector could reach any
host. ``EgressPolicy`` is the canonical, manifest-derived allowlist the
transport enforces.

The policy owns no decision — it is a projection of the manifest — and it is
deliberately default-deny: an empty allowlist means no network at all, not open
network. A connector that declares egress hosts cannot run until a gateway that
restricts outbound traffic to exactly those hosts is configured; the transport
fails closed rather than fall back to unrestricted egress.
