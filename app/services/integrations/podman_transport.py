"""Rootless-Podman transport for the external connector runtime.

Phase 3 of ADR 0004, transport half. Implements ``RunnerTransport`` by running
the connector's digest-pinned image as a short-lived, hardened, rootless Podman
container: the ``RunnerRequest`` JSON goes in on stdin, the ``RunnerResponse``
JSON comes back on stdout, the container is killed at the deadline and removed.

Security posture (ADR 0004 resolved decision 1). Every container runs
``--read-only`` with ``--cap-drop=ALL``, ``--security-opt=no-new-privileges``,
no host mounts, and bounded memory, CPU, and pids. Rootless execution maps
container-root to an unprivileged host uid, so an escape lands unprivileged.
Secret material is written to a tmpfs env file readable only by this user,
passed with ``--env-file`` (never on argv, where ``ps`` would expose it), and
deleted in a ``finally``.

Egress is default-deny (Phase 4). The transport takes an ``EgressPolicy`` derived
from the connector's manifest: a connector with no declared hosts runs with
``--network=none``; one that declares hosts requires an allowlist gateway that
confines outbound traffic to exactly those hosts, and until such a gateway
exists (Phase 4b) the transport refuses to run it rather than grant an open
network.

``_build_argv`` is a pure function so the exact command — the security flags in
particular — is unit-tested without invoking Podman. The live exchange is
covered by an integration test that runs a real example connector on a host
where Podman is present.
