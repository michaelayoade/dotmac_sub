"""Delivery substrate for the ``field_erp_sync_events`` outbox (ERP re-home, PR 1).

Field-service money-path actions ``enqueue`` an intent here with a stable
idempotency key; ``deliver_pending`` posts each pending row to ERP's existing
``/sync/crm/*`` API and records the terminal outcome.

Two invariants make this safe on the money path:

1. **Single writer per flow.** ``deliver_pending`` refuses to send any flow sub
   does not own in ``sync_flow_ownership`` (it logs and skips — never errors).
   ERP idempotency keys are per-originator-id and CRM/sub use different UUID
   spaces, so a mis-sequenced cutover that let both push would double-post; the
   ownership gate is the control that prevents it.
2. **Idempotent re-delivery.** The idempotency key is stored on the row and sent
   as the ``Idempotency-Key`` header, so re-posting a row ERP already saw is a
   no-op on the ERP side.

PR 1 wires no real flow (every flow is still owned by CRM); PR 2 flips
``expense_claim`` to sub and enqueues real rows.
