"""Expense-claim flow for the Sub → DotMac ERP outbox.

This is the first real money flow to move onto sub's ``field_erp_sync_events``
outbox. It ports ``dotmac_crm/app/services/dotmac_erp/expense_request_sync.py``
onto sub's native ``FieldExpenseRequest`` (which already carries the ERP mirror
fields ``expense_claim_reference`` / ``expense_claim_number`` / ``expense_claim_status``).

Three responsibilities live here:

* **map + release** — manager approval builds a versioned claim-and-receipt
  payload and hands it to ``outbox.enqueue``. Submission remains local and
  creates no ERP event. The worker owns delivery, and the outbox refuses any
  flow Sub does not own in ``sync_flow_ownership``.
* **write-back** — ``apply_erp_response`` runs on the outbox's accepted/rejected
  path and writes the ERP claim id / number / status back onto the source row
  (the "dropped money link" mitigation from the review doc).
* **reconcile** — ``refresh_expense_claim_statuses`` polls ERP for in-flight
  claims and refreshes the mirror fields (ports CRM's status-poll refresh).

INERT UNTIL CUTOVER: nothing here sends. Manager approval stages a durable event
only when ``sync_flow_ownership.expense_claim`` belongs to Sub (seeded ``crm``).
The worker resolves the ERP capability when it delivers that event. Ownership
must move to Sub at cutover before a single claim reaches ERP.

    delivered row.

    Restricted to ``status IN ('accepted', 'sent')`` so a ``rejected``/``dead``
    row's response is never written back as if ERP had accepted it.

    SAFE-SCOPE NOTE (this function is intentionally NOT wired into the Celery
    beat schedule — see the task registry / scheduler config, unchanged by
    this change): ``docs/runbooks/EXPENSE_CLAIM_ERP_CUTOVER.md`` prohibits
    backfilling ERP delivery for expenses that were approved before a flow's
    cutover to Sub. A row can only exist in ``field_erp_sync_events`` with
    status ``sent``/``accepted`` if ``outbox.deliver_pending`` actually posted
    it while sub owned the flow at THAT time — so no candidate row here is a
    pre-cutover historical row the runbook's "no backfill" prohibition is
    about. But ownership is not a one-way gate: it can move back to CRM after
    delivery (the cutover/shadow-phase model this codebase uses), and this is
    a repair a schedule could leave running indefinitely — so it does NOT
    infer current ownership from a row's past delivery. See the OWNERSHIP
    GUARD note below. Wiring the scheduler call itself is still left to
    Michael's explicit confirmation rather than resolved here, since the
    runbook's prohibition is a data-safety rule this change does not own.

    OWNERSHIP GUARD: ``flow_owned_by_sub`` is checked once up front (ownership
    is a per-flow switch, not per-row). Re-applying a stored response is a
    state mutation implying ERP involvement — skipped, not repaired, for
    every row when sub does not currently own this flow, and counted under
    ``skipped_not_owned`` so this sweep's own numbers stay honest.
