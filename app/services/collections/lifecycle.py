"""`collections.lifecycle` — one reason-scoped collections owner (ADR 0007 §8).

Both mode policies feed this owner their typed proposals. It alone owns the
case per account/subscription/reason, the warning and escalation states, the
exact durable timers for the next action, consequence-request idempotency, and
close/reopen evidence.

It never mutates subscription or RADIUS state: escalation emits a
reason-scoped consequence request as a durable owner output, and only
`access.subscription_lifecycle` applies or removes the matching restriction.
Settlement or funding closes the case through the same owner, replacing or
canceling its timers.
