"""NCC complaints-return workbook: the XLSX a compliance officer files.

Ported from dotmac_crm's ``app/web/admin/reports.py`` for the CRM exit — CRM
owns NCC return ① (Quarterly Complaints) today and leaves the operation, so
the workbook comes with it. The builder is pure: it takes already-derived
records and emits bytes, touching no models. It hand-writes OOXML (zip + cell
XML) because neither repo carries an Excel library and the format needs are
narrow — two sheets, styles, column widths, and data validation.

What the officer relies on, preserved exactly from CRM:

* **Dropdowns** on every constrained column, sourced from a hidden
  ``_NCC_Dropdowns`` sheet, so a filing cannot carry a value NCC rejects.
* **A per-row VALIDATION STATUS** column reading ``[OK] All validations
  passed`` or ``[FAIL] <reason>; <reason>`` with the offending Excel column
  letters, plus green/red row shading — the officer fixes the reds and files.

The reference tables below (categories + per-category SLA hours, 87
subcategory issue codes, 38 states and their LGAs) are the regulator's
vocabulary. They are exported publicly because the records builder needs the
same vocabulary to derive rows; if a third consumer appears, lift them into
their own ``ncc_reference`` module rather than copying them.
