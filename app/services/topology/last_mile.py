"""Last-mile diagnoser — P2 (design: docs/designs/OUTAGE_CLASSIFIER.md §5).

When P1 says a subscription's session is DOWN but the infra above it is UP
(``service_fault`` / a localized boundary with survivors), *why* is this one
customer offline? Descend the last-mile ladder (§5) and name it, so support and
selfcare get "reboot your router" vs "your ONT has no power" vs "a tech is
needed" instead of a useless "area down".

The ladder — each rung a signal already on prod (§5)::

    session (PPPoE)          ← symptom: no fresh RadiusActiveSession
      ⇑ CPE authenticating    ← RADIUS reject (radius_auth_errors) + ACS inform
      ⇑ CPE link healthy      ← optical Rx (fiber) / RF (wireless — see gap)
      ⇑ CPE present at node    ← ONT olt_status / radio last_uisp_status
      ⇑ CPE powered           ← absent everywhere ⟹ off / drop cut

Verdicts (§5 table): ``power`` (off / drop cut), ``signal_degraded`` (present,
bad signal — schedule tech), ``router_offline`` (present, good signal, ACS
stale — "reboot"), ``auth`` (present, informing, RADIUS reject — operator-fix,
no truck), ``config`` (present, good signal, no RADIUS attempt — not dialing),
plus ``healthy`` (session actually up) and ``unknown`` (insufficient linkage /
signal, or the fault is upstream and P1 owns it).

**Medium asymmetry (design §4 — the real P2 gap).** Fiber ONTs report presence
(``olt_status``), optical Rx (``onu_rx_signal_dbm``) and an offline *reason*
(power_fail / los / dying_gasp), so the fiber ladder is complete. Wireless radios
(``CPEDevice``) store only ``last_uisp_status`` (active / disconnected /
unauthorized / vanished) — **no RF/RSSI value exists on prod** — so the wireless
link-signal rung is unobservable: ``signal_dbm`` is ``None`` and ``signal_degraded``
can't be diagnosed for wireless. We report presence + auth honestly and stop
there rather than fabricate an RF verdict.

Out of P2 scope (documented TODOs): flapping / degraded-vs-down separation
(§7.7), maintenance-window suppression (§7.8), splice inference (§6, P3),
surfaces (P4).
