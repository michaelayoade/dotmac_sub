"""Automated trigger for customer outage notifications (ADR 0004).

``outage_notifications`` deliberately had no auto-trigger: dispatch required a
human clicking ``/admin/network/detected-outages/notify``. In production nobody
ever clicked it — 3,723 incidents were detected in 17 days and
``outage_notification_dispatches`` stayed empty — so customers learned about
outages by contacting support. This module supplies the trigger the design
withheld, under a narrower gate than the manual path.

**This module does not decide who to notify, what to say, or on which channel.**
It selects which incidents are automation-eligible and then calls
``dispatch_outage_notifications``, which keeps every guard it already had
(confidence gate, persisted debounce, per-run cap, opt-out, audit row). Channel
selection remains ``notification_channel_policy``'s.

Automation is narrower than a human dispatch on purpose:

* off by default (``outage_auto_notify_enabled``)
* classifier ``node_outage`` only — ``radio_cluster`` is too noisy to automate
  (2,252 of 2,459 such production incidents ended ``discarded``)
* the incident must have been customer-visible for a settling period, so a
  blip that self-clears never reaches a customer
* a minimum affected-subscriber count
* a per-run incident cap, independent of the per-run recipient cap below it
* dispatches are stamped with :data:`AUTO_ACTOR_ID` so an auditor can always
  separate automated sends from operator sends
