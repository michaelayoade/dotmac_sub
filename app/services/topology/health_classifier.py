"""Outage classifier — P1 core (design: docs/designs/OUTAGE_CLASSIFIER.md).

Turn the signals already on prod into one self-consistent judgement: *what is
actually down, how deep*. P1 uses two signals only:

  - **data plane** — a live ``RadiusActiveSession`` is proof a customer is
    ACTUALLY served. ``online(E) >= 1`` ⟹ E and everything upstream is UP
    (design §0/§2). One survivor vetoes "down".
  - **mgmt plane** — ``NetworkDevice.live_status`` (native warmer: up/down/
    unknown/problem), the combined reachability+agent signal today.

The two form a dependency ladder (design §1): a live session REQUIRES mgmt up,
so ``session up + mgmt down`` is physically impossible — the mgmt check is
lying, not the device. We never override that contradiction, we flag it
(``monitoring_fault``) so it gets self-healed.

Out of P1 scope (documented TODOs, later phases):
  - temporal ``baseline(E)`` — trigger on deviation, not ``== 0`` (design §2);
    P1 uses a coarse "has provisioned customers" prior-life denominator.
  - splitting mgmt back into separate ping vs snmp signals (design §1 table).
  - last-mile per-customer diagnoser (design §5, P2).
  - splice inference from co-failure / correlated Rx (design §6, P3).
  - maintenance-window suppression (design §7.8) and time-series debounce
    (design §7.6) — P1 is a point-in-time read.
  - admin console / selfcare surfaces / notify send-path (P4).
