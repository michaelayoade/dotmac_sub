"""LLDP neighbor poller -> directed NetworkTopologyLink (Phase 2).

Reads each MikroTik router's ``/ip/neighbor`` (LLDP/CDP/MNDP discovery, enabled
fleet-wide via the ``lldp-infra`` setting) and builds the device-level directed
graph that the empty sysmap never provided. Read-only against routers; the
reconcile owns ``source='lldp_neighbor'`` rows (upsert + soft-prune) and never
touches manual/other links.

Fetch mechanism: the neighbor tables are read over the RouterOS **binary API**
(port 8728, the ``routeros_api`` library) — the exact transport the bandwidth
poller (``app/poller/mikrotik_poller.py``) already uses against these routers.
REST is enabled on MOST of the fleet but binary works on more of it, so binary
is tried first. We iterate the ``routers`` table directly (each row carries the
same user account for API and REST) and map each router to its
``network_device_id``.

REST (443) fallback: the fleet is MIXED — a few core routers (Garki Core,
Abuja Medallion; both CCR1072) have 8728 FILTERED and answer only on HTTPS/REST
(443). #840 moved the poller from REST to binary because binary reached most
routers, but that orphaned those REST-only cores. So a binary read that fails
with a CONNECTION-class error (timeout / refused / no route /
``RouterOsApiConnectionError``) falls back to ``GET /rest/ip/neighbor`` over 443
(:func:`_read_neighbors_via_rest`, the pre-#840 REST path restored). An AUTH
failure is deliberately NOT retried over REST — REST hits the same user/RADIUS
backend, so it would fail identically (e.g. Kubwa's device-side RADIUS "could
not authenticate") — and counts as a plain ``routers_failed`` as before.

Match (``_match_with_strategy``, additive + conservative): exact normalized
neighbor ``identity`` -> network_device name/hostname; then IPv4
``address``/``address4`` -> mgmt_ip (a colon marks an IPv6/``fe80::`` value and
is ignored so link-local-only neighbors still fall through to identity); then a
guarded fuzzy identity match (token subset, ambiguous -> no match) so aliases
like ``BOI Asokoro Access`` -> ``BOI Asokoro`` and ``Abuja Core I Garki`` ->
``Garki Core`` resolve. Empty identity with no IP hit or no match -> dropped
(CPE/unknown). Discovered pairs that already have an authoritative manual link
are not duplicated. There is no device-MAC column on ``network_devices``, so a
MAC strategy is intentionally not implemented (no schema is invented).
