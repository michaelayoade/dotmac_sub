"""Outage incident management (Phase 4b + 5b).

An outage is declared against a node, basestation, or FDH cabinet; the
affected subscriber count is snapshotted from affected_customers at declare
time. Declared either by an operator (manual console) or by the auto-detect
scan (``outage_autodetect``), which marks its incidents via ``declared_by ==
AUTO_DETECT_ACTOR`` + an ``AUTO_NOTE_PREFIX`` note — deliberately NOT a new
column (no migration needed; the model stays lean). No notification sending
here; incident create/resolve fan out to the event system (webhooks) only.
