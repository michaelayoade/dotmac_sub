"""Detected-outage incident reconcile (design §7.6).

The classifier (``health_classifier``) is a point-in-time read: it says what is
dark *right now*. That is too twitchy to notify on — a single missed poll or a
reboot would open and close an "outage" every few minutes. This module adds the
TIME dimension: a discover-reconcile loop that debounces the classifier's
verdicts into a trustworthy incident with a lifecycle, so notify / ticket /
restore / MTTR can later attach to a persisted spine instead of a transient read.

Each pass (mirrors the radius / outage-autodetect sweeps — advisory-lock
single-flight in the task wrapper, per-item savepoint here so one bad candidate
never poisons the run):

1. **Verdicts** — classify every active node with the online
   overlay (``affected.subscriptions_for_nodes`` + proof-of-life) and mgmt
   ``live_status``; keep the nodes currently ``node_outage``. Localize each dark
   node to the deepest dark-under-live boundary (``localize_outage``) -> a
   candidate outage per dark component (root_node, basestation, affected_count,
   confidence, classification).
2. **Identity** — find-or-open an OPEN classifier incident per candidate by the
   §7.6 identity rule (basestation, else exact root, else connected-dark
   component), RE-POINTING the root on localization drift rather than opening a
   duplicate.
3. **Debounce up** — ``suspected -> confirmed`` once the suspicion has persisted
   ``W_confirm(affected_count)`` (impact-scaled), else it stays suspected; a
   suspected incident whose node recovered before W_confirm is ``discarded``
   (the false-positive suppression — no confirmed event ever fires).
4. **Debounce down** — ``confirmed -> clearing`` on recovery (stamp cleared_at),
   ``clearing -> resolved`` once recovery is sustained past ``W_resolve``, and
   ``clearing -> confirmed`` (reopen) if it re-darkens inside the resolve window
   (hysteresis).

Firing stays GATED: this loop only persists the lifecycle and fans lifecycle
events into the existing webhook machinery. No customer / ticket notification is
sent here. MTTR is derivable as ``resolved_at - confirmed_at``.
