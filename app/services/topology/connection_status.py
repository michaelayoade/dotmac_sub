"""Customer connection status — outage classifier P4 surface (design §P4/§5).

Project the internal last-mile diagnosis (P2, ``diagnose_last_mile``) and the
area-outage localization (P1, ``localize_outage``) into a **customer-safe**
answer to "what's wrong with my connection?".

The core rule is the **area-vs-last-mile split** (design §5 + §7.3): if this
customer sits under an *active area outage* (their access node is dark for
everyone — P1 ``node_outage``), we tell them "known outage, we're on it" and
**suppress the last-mile blame** ("reboot your router") — it is not their
router's fault, and telling 200 people on a cut splitter to reboot is noise.
Only when there is no area outage do we surface the per-customer verdict.

Customer-safe means: no internal node names/ids, no raw signal values, no
verdict internals, nothing about other customers. ``assess()`` returns the full
internal view (operator-side, used by the notifier for dedup); ``connection_status()``
returns only the projected safe payload.

Relationship to ``selfcare.customer_connection_status``: that older surface (used
by the mobile ``/api/me`` banner) returns a coarse healthy/degraded/outage state
from live-status + operator incidents. This module is the richer P2/P1-aware
successor — it adds the per-customer last-mile verdict and the area-vs-last-mile
blame split — and it reuses the SAME authoritative ``open_incident_for_path``
signal, so the two never disagree about whether an area outage is in progress.
