"""Topology live-status warmer.

Derives a coarse ``live_status`` (up/down/unknown) for reconciled topology
nodes from the native poll columns the infrastructure poller maintains
(``last_ping_*`` / ``last_snmp_*``, see ``services.infrastructure_polling``)
and writes it into the network_devices cache. A failed ping is always the
primary outage signal; ping success is the primary healthy signal; SNMP
reachability is used only when there is no fresh ping result. The Network
Path panel reads that cache — no probe ever runs on the request path (same
warm-and-store pattern as ``monitoring_warm``).

Formerly this warmer batch-fetched Zabbix host availability for reconciled
(``source == zabbix_reconcile``) nodes; the derived statuses, heartbeat key
and SLA availability bridge are unchanged, but the data source moved to the
native poll columns and the population is now source-agnostic: every active
*pollable* device (same predicate as the poll sweep) gets a live_status,
however its row was created. Unpollable devices keep a NULL live_status so
surfaces with their own fallbacks (e.g. linked-router status) still apply
them. The old ``uisp.status`` trapper fallback is gone: radio/CPE health
feeds the outage pipeline natively via ``CPEDevice.last_uisp_status``
(uisp_sync), and a pollable node with neither a fresh ping nor SNMP result
reads ``unknown``, which every consumer already treats conservatively.
