"""Project committed lifecycle facts into downstream sales-service owners.

The handler is a thin delivery adapter: funding satisfaction, vendor
verification, service-order release/completion, and CX acceptance remain
facts owned by their originating services. The verified-implementation,
release, and acceptance consequences run through ``sales.fulfillment``'s
receipted consumer commands on a fresh owner-command session — the effect
and its unique ``(consumer, event_id)`` receipt commit atomically, so a
redelivery is an exact no-op. A consequence that cannot be applied raises
so the event delivery stays failed and retryable instead of a warning log.

The funding consequence is the one hop still consumed without a receipt:
its effect creates subscriptions and invoices through billing/catalog
creators that commit internally, which ``execute_owner_command`` correctly
forbids. It stays idempotent on business keys until those creators are
commit-free participants.
