"""Editor/form page contracts — the ``ui.form_contracts`` owner.

The UI information/action standard requires every editor to describe a
transition, not a bag of fields: show current and proposed state, surface
prerequisites near the affected control, preview impact before high-impact
changes, and name irreversible consequences. This module owns the declarative
vocabulary for that contract; the *owning domain service* evaluates the
prerequisites and computes the impact — templates render the evaluated state
and never re-derive eligibility.

Pilot consumer: the customer plan-change editor
(``customer_portal_flow_changes.PLAN_CHANGE_FORM``).
