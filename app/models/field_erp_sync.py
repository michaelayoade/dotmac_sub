"""Native sub → DotMac ERP delivery substrate (ERP re-home, PR 1).

Two tables:

* ``field_erp_sync_events`` — the OUTBOX. Field-service money-path actions
  (expense claims, material requests, purchase orders, purchase invoices)
  enqueue a row here with a stable ``idempotency_key``; a background worker
  posts each pending row to ERP's existing ``/sync/crm/*`` API and records the
  terminal outcome. The idempotency key is stored and sent, so re-delivery of a
  row ERP already saw is safe.

* ``sync_flow_ownership`` — the SINGLE-WRITER GUARD (Michael's addition). One
  row per flow naming the app that currently owns the ERP write path for it.
  Seeded to ``crm`` for every flow: CRM keeps writing until a flow is explicitly
  cut over to sub. The outbox REFUSES to deliver any flow sub does not own, so
  the double-push-across-id-spaces hazard (ERP idempotency keys are
  per-originator-id, and CRM and sub use different UUID spaces) cannot fire
  during a mis-sequenced cutover.

Status/flow/owner columns are stored as ``String`` (app-level enums, not PG
enums) — the same idiom as the maps §A vendor-route domain (migration 248), so
the schema builds cleanly on both Postgres and the sqlite test harness.
