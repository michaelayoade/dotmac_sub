"""Domain settings storage and the open ``SettingDomain`` member type.

``SettingDomain`` used to be a closed ``enum.Enum`` stored as a native
PostgreSQL enum, so adding a domain meant an ``ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE``
migration in this hosting layer — see ``144_vas_wallets.py``,
``225_add_field_setting_domain.py`` and ``249_field_erp_sync_outbox.py``, whose
entire content is adding a member on behalf of some other module. That is the
shape ADR-0008 (fleet-wide: module-declared vocabularies, never
host-enumerated lists) forbids: the members of this vocabulary belong to the
domains that own the settings, not to this module.

So the type is now OPEN — a ``str`` subclass any value can construct — and the
authority moved to the declaration registry in
``app.services.setting_domain_registry``, which reads ``setting_domains`` off
the canonical SOT domain records. Validation happens at the WRITE boundary (the
ORM listener at the bottom of this module), not at construction: reads of rows
written under a since-undeclared domain must keep working, and a resolver must
be able to name a domain it is about to reject.

The class attributes below are ACCESSORS for the domains Sub declares today.
They exist so the ~1,300 existing ``SettingDomain.<name>`` call sites keep
working unchanged, and they are a documented, tested SUBSET of the declared
set: declaring a new domain must NOT require editing this module. See
``tests/architecture/test_setting_domain_registry.py``.
