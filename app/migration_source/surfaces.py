"""Who writes, adapts and consumes cohort-isp-01 source state today.

The writer *census* is mechanical — `scripts/architecture/isp_cohort_writers.py`
counts it from the AST, and two ratchets freeze the result. This module is the
other half: what each counted surface **is**, which no static scan can decide.
A file that assigns `subscriber.status` and a file that assigns
`subscriber.metadata_` are the same shape to a parser and completely different
facts to a migration.

## Three questions, three vocabularies

The first version of this inventory answered all of it with one enum, and the
enum kept forcing dishonest answers. An applied migration is not an
"authorized adapter", but calling it a "legacy parallel writer" reads as
something a cutover could retire. A fixture seeder writes real rows and has no
authority at all. Those are not edge cases in one classification — they are
three independent questions being asked at once:

- **`AuthorityRole`** — what say does this surface have over the fact?
- **`BoundaryRole`** — what does it actually do at the boundary?
- **`Reachability`** — how can it still be reached against production?

They are genuinely orthogonal, and
`tests/test_isp_cohort_source_readiness.py::test_the_three_axes_are_orthogonal`
proves it rather than asserting it: for every ordered pair of axes, knowing one
value must leave at least two possibilities open on the other. If a future
inventory collapses to where one axis determines another, that test fails and
the axes should be merged rather than quietly kept apart.

`SurfaceClassification` survives as a *derived* view over the axes, so the
original eight-member vocabulary — and every document written against it —
still means what it meant.

## A disposition, for every surface

Classification says what a surface is. It does not say what happens to it, and
"what happens to it" is the question a cutover actually needs answered. Every
surface therefore carries a `Disposition`, including the adapters and readers
that write nothing: a route that reads a customer account has to come from
somewhere after that account lives in another application.

`Disposition.UNDECIDED` is a real state and carries a required `open_question`.
Three surfaces hold one today. They are enumerable through
`undecided_surfaces()` precisely so they cannot be lost between here and
`ctl-isp-006`.

## The classification is a finding, not a plan

`PARALLEL_WRITER` here does not schedule anything. It records that a second
path writes a fact some other owner is declared to own, so the cutover sequence
knows what has to be displaced before authority can move. Nothing in this
module retires, disables or reroutes a writer; Sub remains the sole production
writer for this cohort until a separately authorised sealed switch.

## UNDETERMINED means undetermined

Each axis has an `UNDETERMINED` member reserved for a surface whose answer was
looked for and not established. It is never a synonym for "none found" and
never a placeholder for "probably fine" — an undetermined axis is an open
question carried into the cutover gate, and the validators below refuse one
that does not say what is unknown about it.

The inverse matters just as much. `organizations` and `organization_memberships`
have **no** counted writer, and that is a searched result rather than an
absence of effort: no construction, no tracked mutation, no set-based DML and
no raw statement names them anywhere under `app/`, `scripts/` or the executable
migration lineage. That is recorded as a stated finding in
`TABLES_WITH_NO_COUNTED_WRITER`, with the census's blind spots named alongside
it, so nobody later reads the empty result as undetermined or as proof.
