"""JSON authentication API for vendor (contractor) technicians in the field app.

**Adapter only.** Nothing here decides anything. Two owners are composed:

* ``app.services.auth_flow.AuthFlow`` owns credential verification, MFA
  verification, access-token minting, refresh rotation with reuse detection,
  and session revocation. It is the same owner behind ``/api/v1/auth/*``.
* ``app.services.field.vendor_auth`` owns vendor admission — the pre-credential
  eligibility decision (``resolve_vendor_login_eligibility``) and the
  post-issue check that a minted token belongs to an active member of an active
  vendor (``resolve_vendor_admission_for_access_token``).

This module deliberately does NOT reuse ``app/web/vendor_auth.py``. That router
is the BROWSER adapter: it renders Jinja templates, sets session cookies and
answers with 303 redirects. Aliasing a JSON path onto an HTML form handler
would make one handler serve two transports and one of them badly. The HTML
adapter stays exactly as it is; this is the second transport over the same
owners.

The paths, request bodies and response bodies match what the shipped field app
already sends and parses — see ``tests/test_vendor_auth_api_contract.py``,
which pins them against ``field_mobile``'s Dart client. They were missing
entirely until now: the field app posted to ``/api/v1/vendor/auth/login`` while
Sub mounted only the unprefixed HTML ``/vendor/auth/login``, so vendor login,
MFA and refresh all answered 404 and vendor technicians could not sign in.
