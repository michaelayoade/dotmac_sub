"""Sub's `messaging.receive.v1` port for the independently deployed Integrator.

Adapter only. It authenticates, normalizes, records, delegates and answers. It
owns no business decision: if a reviewer can point at one inside this file, the
file is wrong.

## Why this authenticates the Integrator and not the provider

Sub's older inbound routes verify a provider HMAC over raw request bytes. That
is the right control when Sub is the party talking to the provider. Here Sub is
not: the Integrator is. By the time bytes arrive they have already been verified
once in the Integrator's deployment, then re-serialized into a provider-neutral
envelope. The provider's signature no longer covers them, so re-checking it here
would be checking a signature over a body that is not the signed body — a check
that looks like security and is not.

The caller is therefore authenticated as a machine principal: an ``ApiKey`` with
``system_user_id`` set, presented as ``X-Api-Key``, bearing a dedicated scope.
``ApiKey.scopes`` is already fail-closed on empty and ``revoked_at`` already
gives revocation, so no fourth credential shape is invented for one caller.

## What the credential does not grant

Authentication answers *who is calling*, never *where this lands*. The envelope
names no conversation, team, queue or subscriber, and the port would refuse them
if it did — the schema forbids extra fields. ``scope`` is the Integrator's own
binding scope and is recorded as provenance on the transport receipt; Sub's
routing owner decides where the message actually goes. This is Sub's half of the
destination invariant that ``dotmac_integration.destination_binding`` enforces on
the other side of the wire.

## The chain, and that every link is somebody else's

    authenticate  -> require_permission(INTEGRATOR_OBSERVATION_SCOPE)
    bind          -> integrations.runtime_execution.build_execution_context
    normalize     -> team_inbox_integrator_envelope.normalize
    receipt       -> integrations.inbox.receive_and_claim_verified
    the FACT      -> team_inbox_observations.record_provider_observation
    the CONSEQUENCE -> team_inbox_processing.process_provider_observation
    settle        -> integrations.inbox.complete_consequence / fail_consequence

Two dedup layers appear there and they are not redundant. The receipt is keyed
``(capability_binding_id, provider_event_id)`` and answers "have I accepted
these bytes on this binding?". The observation is keyed
``(provider, provider_account_scope, provider_event_id)`` and answers "have I
already recorded this fact?". Two bindings legitimately observing one upstream
event are two receipts and one observation.
