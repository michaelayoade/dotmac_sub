"""Sub Thin Shadow — the typed cohort/cutover contract for a disposable environment.

This package is **governance, not runtime**. Nothing here is imported by Sub's
request path, and nothing here decides anything about Sub. It exists to answer
one question truthfully and mechanically:

    for each reusable module in the cohort, what has *actually* happened to it?

## Why it lives under `app/`

`make check` in this repository points ruff, mypy and bandit at `app/` only.
Placing a typed contract anywhere else would leave the rule it enforces —
"public inputs and outputs are strongly typed, never `Any` or an unshaped dict"
— unenforced by the very gate that is supposed to prove it. Living here means
the contract is checked by the existing gates with no Makefile change.

## What the shadow environment is, and is not

It is a disposable, egress-denied, synthetic-data stack (`/opt/dotmac-sub-thin-shadow`,
compose project `dotmac-sub-thin-shadow`, loopback `127.0.0.1:18001`) in which
module authority may be switched over *synthetic* data.

It is **not** a second live financial authority, and it satisfies **no**
production cutover gate. `AuthorityMode` has no production member and
`CohortManifest.environment` is `Literal["shadow"]`, so neither of those claims
is expressible in this contract rather than merely discouraged by it.

## Reading the states

`source_only → released_uncomposed → installed_shadow → compared → shadow_authority`.

Each step demands the evidence of the one below: a state past `source_only`
requires a digest-pinned release identity, `compared` and beyond require a
satisfied comparison gate carrying its reconciliation hash, and shadow authority
requires that no blocking prerequisite stands and that some Sub writer is named
as displaced. Today Subscriptions, Billing and Collections are
`released_uncomposed`; every other member remains `source_only`. See `cohort`
for the immutable release and Thin Shadow image evidence behind that boundary.
