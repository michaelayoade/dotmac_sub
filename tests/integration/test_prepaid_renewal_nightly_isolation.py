"""Nightly isolation: rollback/atomicity, the poison-pill regression, and the
fatal-abort complement -- proving the split policy produces two genuinely
different, correct behaviors, not just one.

Two real PostgreSQL accounts in one nightly batch:

- Account A is constructed to produce a genuine `legacy_unbacked_funding`
  classification (real divergence, no monkeypatch): a reversed payment
  leaves an unmatched ledger credit that is never payment-backed. This is
  the SAME established, verified fixture pattern this codebase already uses
  for exactly this disposition
  (`tests/test_prepaid_draft_reconciliation.py::test_reversed_payment_is_not_reused_with_opening_funding`).
  `unbacked_credit > 0` unconditionally routes `classify_prospective_prepaid_funding`
  past the `reviewed_opening_fundable` branch (which requires
  `unbacked_credit == 0`) into `insufficient_funding`/`legacy_unbacked_funding`
  -- ambiguous, pre-mutation, `PrepaidRenewalAmbiguousEvidenceError`.
- Account B has EXACT reviewed-opening funding for its own real resolved
  charge (`resolve_prepaid_monthly_charge_detail` -- the same resolver
  `confirm_prepaid_service_renewal` itself calls) and must renew
  successfully in the SAME batch despite A's failure.

A separate, complementary test proves the opposite: an UNCLASSIFIED failure
(not one of the 3 allowlisted types) aborts the WHOLE pass, and an account
sequenced after the failing one is never even reached.

Uses the established two-real-connection PostgreSQL pattern
(`tests/integration/test_account_credit_concurrency.py`,
`tests/integration/test_prepaid_funding_trigger_execution_rollback.py`),
driven through the real production entry point
(`execute_due_prepaid_service_renewals` -> `execute_owner_command`).
