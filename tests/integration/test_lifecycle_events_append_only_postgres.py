"""The append-only guarantee, proven where it is actually enforced.

The service no longer exposes `update`/`delete`, but a service can be re-added
by a later refactor and a database trigger cannot be argued with. SLA
eligibility will rest on these rows, so the guarantee has to hold against any
writer — ORM, raw SQL or a future admin tool.

Runs on the migrated PostgreSQL target from `make test-integration`; the
trigger is migration-only and a metadata-built schema does not have it.
