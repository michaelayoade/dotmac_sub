"""The mismatched-replay review item must survive the transaction it's raised in.

`evaluate_prepaid_service_after_settlement`'s mismatched-replay path writes a
`PrepaidDraftReconciliationException` review item and then raises a permanent,
non-retryable error. When driven through the real entry point
(`execute_prepaid_service_after_settlement`), that raise unwinds
`execute_owner_command`'s whole transaction -- so the review item write must
happen on a genuinely independent connection/transaction
(`_record_review_item_out_of_band`), or it is destroyed by the very rollback
it exists to survive.

This can only be proven with a REAL, separate PostgreSQL connection --
SQLite's `StaticPool` test lane shares one physical connection for the whole
test, so a "second" session there is still inside the same uncommitted
transaction and would falsely appear to roll back the write even if the
production code were correct. Requires `TEST_DATABASE_URL`
(`make test-db-up && make test-integration`).

Assumes the application's own `SessionLocal` (`app.db.get_engine()`) resolves
to the SAME PostgreSQL instance as `TEST_DATABASE_URL` in this run -- the
same assumption every other owner-command integration test in this suite
already depends on.
