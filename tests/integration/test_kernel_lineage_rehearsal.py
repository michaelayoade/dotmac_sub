"""Does the kernel's migration lineage actually apply to Sub's schema?

This is the ADR-0017 gate, executed rather than described. Everything the
starter's `docs/inventories/sub-lineage-dispositions.md` says about collisions
was derived by parsing migration files in two repositories, and that method
produced four confident wrong answers before it was right. A database answers
the question definitively, and answers a larger one besides: parsing can compare
table NAMES, but only Postgres can tell you a column type conflicts, a CHECK
rejects existing rows, or an RLS policy collides.

## What it does

1. Provisions an isolated database (same fixture shape as the other migration
   rehearsals in this directory).
2. Builds **Sub's real schema by running Sub's own alembic chain to head** —
   never `create_all`, per the standing rule that database-backed acceptance
   uses production-engine schemas built by the real migration chain.
3. Points alembic at the **installed kernel's** migration directory and attempts
   to run that lineage on top.
4. Records exactly which revision fails and why.

The kernel lineage is expected to fail today, and the point is to pin WHERE.
Each disposition that lands moves the failure later; when it stops failing, the
gate is closed and the kernel lineage runs in a product database. That is a
ratchet, in the ADR-0018 sense — `EXPECTED_FIRST_FAILURE` may only move forward,
and a run that gets further than expected fails this test so the expectation is
lowered deliberately rather than drifting.

## Why the failure is asserted rather than tolerated

A test that merely reported would go unread. Asserting the exact failure point
means a disposition landing anywhere in the chain is visible immediately, and an
accidental regression in an already-dispositioned table is caught by the same
assertion.
