"""Slice 5: the gate before conversation traffic moves onto this workspace.

Production carries 84 conversations against CRM's ~37,539 and has never
exercised operator workflows at scale, so this asserts the three things that
have to hold before that changes:

1. **RBAC** — every mutating route is gated on `support:ticket:update`, every
   read on `support:ticket:read`, and the drawer's sensitive fields have their
   own gates.
2. **Attribution** — every operator mutation records *who* did it. There is no
   central audit trail for inbox commands (see the module note below), so the
   per-row actor columns are the whole story and must not regress.
3. **Volume** — the queue read stays correct and bounded as the table grows.

On audit: neither `team_inbox_commands` nor `execute_owner_command` writes
`audit_events`. Provenance is split: the relational rows carry proper actor
columns (`InboxComment.author_person_id`,
`InboxConversationLabel.applied_by_person_id`,
`InboxConversationAssignment.assigned_by_person_id`), while **everything
written to `InboxMessage` puts the actor in JSON metadata instead** — replies
as `sent_by_person_id`, internal notes as `actor_id` — and conversation
workflow changes live in `workflow_history` metadata. `communications.conversation_ticket_handoff` is
the exception and does stage an audit event. That split is deliberate enough to
pin, so a future change cannot quietly drop attribution.
