"""Regression tests for credential-level throttle precedence in populate() (SP-2).

A dunning/FUP throttle is applied by setting ``AccessCredential.
radius_profile_id``. Before this fix, populate() rebuilt radreply purely from
the subscription/offer profile and ignored that override, so every throttle was
silently reverted within one sweep and never reached the router. populate() now
resolves the effective profile with credential > subscription precedence via
``_effective_profile``; these tests pin that precedence and the offer-derived
rate that flows from it.
