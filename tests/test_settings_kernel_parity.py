"""Every spec resolves to the same value through the kernel as it did before.

The cutover's evidence. Michael's ruling was one cutover rather than a staged
shadow, with parity proven over all specs rather than sampled — so this is that
proof, carried in the change that causes it rather than as a separate phase.

It compares the KERNEL's answer against Sub's former resolution rules, which
are reproduced here as `_legacy_resolution` rather than referenced, because the
point is to pin the behaviour that existed before `resolve_value` was rewritten.
When this test and the kernel disagree, one of them is wrong and the
disagreement is the finding.

Two deltas are expected and asserted as such rather than tolerated silently:

- **Unseeded env-declared specs.** The kernel materialises `env_var` into rows
  via `seed_settings_from_env`; a spec with no row and no seed still resolves
  to its default here because this test sets no environment.
- **Nothing else.** Any other difference is a defect.
