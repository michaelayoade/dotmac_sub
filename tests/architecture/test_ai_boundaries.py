"""Architecture guard: AI is advisory — it never writes domain state.

``docs/designs/AI_SOT.md`` / SOT map §AI Control Plane. AI observes, derives,
and recommends; acting on a recommendation means calling the domain's declared
owner (``support.ticket_lifecycle``, ``operations.work_orders``,
``operations.project_lifecycle``, ``communications.team_inbox_commands``), which applies
its own guards, events, and audit.

The failure this prevents: an LLM suggestion silently becoming a domain
transition that bypassed its owner's rules — an unreviewable authority leak,
and precisely the parallel decision path the source-of-truth standard forbids.

Two invariants:
1. No ``app/services/ai*`` module constructs or session-writes a non-AI ORM
   row (it may write AIInsight/AiIntakeConfig — that is its own derived
   state).
2. ``ai_operations`` is the only writer of ``AIInsight``.
