"""Subscription.status has one transition owner: app.services.account_lifecycle.

The 2026-07-13 re-audit traced customer-impacting incidents to raw
``subscription.status = ...`` writes that bypassed
``assert_legal_subscription_transition`` and the enforcement-lock ledger — see
tests/test_access_enforcement_strays.py (S3: the reseller portal reactivated
with a raw status write, so nothing re-provisioned the service). Those callers
were routed through the owner; this test pins the consolidation so a new raw
writer is a build failure, not a re-audit finding.

Allowlisted writers (each an explicit ownership decision):

- ``app/services/account_lifecycle.py`` — the transition owner.
- ``app/services/catalog/subscriptions.py`` — gated coordinator: it calls
  ``assert_legal_subscription_transition`` before transitioning, and its
  ``_revert_failed_activation`` compensation write restores the
  pre-transition status when PPPoE credential minting fails mid-activation.
- ``app/services/web_system_restore_tool.py`` — snapshot-restore tooling:
  reinstates recorded state; not a business transition.

Detection is AST-based, not string matching: any attribute assignment whose
target is named ``status`` and whose right-hand side references
``SubscriptionStatus`` counts as a subscription transition write. Constructor
keywords (``Subscription(status=...)``) are creation, not transition, and are
deliberately out of scope. KNOWN LIMIT (disclosed, not hidden): a write
laundered through a local variable (``s = SubscriptionStatus.active; sub.status
= s``) evades the value check unless the variable name itself ends in
``status`` AND the receiver is named ``subscription*`` — the secondary
heuristic below catches the common spelling without flagging the many other
``<run|job>.status = status`` job-state writes, and ``Subscriber.status``
display writes stay excluded because their right-hand sides reference
``AccountStatus``/derived helpers, not ``SubscriptionStatus``.
