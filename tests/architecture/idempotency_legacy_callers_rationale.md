# Rationale — `idempotency_legacy_callers.txt`

`idempotency_legacy_callers.txt` is a two-directional ratchet baseline
(`tests/architecture/test_idempotency_legacy_ratchet.py`) and is read as a
bare, sorted, deduplicated list of file paths compared exactly against the
observed reference set — it cannot itself carry inline comments without
breaking that equality check. This file records, alongside the baseline,
the reviewed reason each addition was accepted rather than refused, so
"new callers are forbidden" stays a reviewed containment boundary and not a
silent expansion.

## `app/services/account_recovery.py` — added 2026-09-16

**Why this reviewed caller is warranted.** `customer.account_recovery` owns
recoverable deletion, restoration and evidence re-baselining as one
owner-command transaction per request. Each command must reserve its caller
key and preserve the original typed outcome, including an unchanged preflight
refusal or a partial restore. This slice uses Sub's still-authoritative
`IdempotencyKey` ledger for the reservation and recovery-local immutable
result rows for values too large to fit in the ledger reference. It does not
create a second ledger or bypass the exact caller census. The account row is
locked before the first reservation in all three commands, so same-account
concurrent retries serialize even when the key row does not yet exist.

**Why this is transitional, not a standing expansion.** ADR-0011's
2026-08-25 amendment keeps the local ledger authoritative and explicitly
forbids importing `dotmac_kernel.idempotency` under `app/` until the product
runtime cutover is composed and verified. The existing offer-admission owner
below is the same reviewed coexistence case. Adding this path to the sorted
two-directional baseline makes the exception visible and red-sensitive; it
does not weaken the detector or authorize further callers.

**Retirement.** Remove this path and its local-ledger reservation when Sub's
idempotency runtime cutover installs the pinned Kernel distribution, composes
the correct persistence plane, proves fresh and predecessor migrations plus
isolation/parity, and migrates the account-recovery owner as an explicit
domain slice. Do not infer that migration 556's inert storage is adoption.

## `app/services/catalog/offer_access_requirement.py` — added 2026-09-16

**Why a 33rd caller is warranted.** This module is the sole owner of
access-classified offer-version admission (`AdmitOfferVersionCommand`) and
reviewed legacy-version classification. Both owner commands need
replay-safe, exactly-once admission under a caller-supplied idempotency key
(concurrent retries, at-least-once delivery from upstream callers). The
module reserves and consumes rows in the shared `idempotency_keys` ledger
via `app.models.idempotency.IdempotencyKey`, in the same hand-rolled
reservation-over-the-model shape as every other entry already in this
baseline (advisory lock, look up existing key in scope, compare stored
inputs, insert on first use, return the stored result on replay). It does
not introduce a new mechanism.

**Why there is no sanctioned alternative.**
`docs/adr/0011-module-lineage-composition.md`'s 2026-08-25 amendment
("a product revision may supply a runtime prerequisite") is explicit:
`IdempotencyKey`, `TaskExecution` and `idempotent_task` **remain
authoritative**, and `dotmac_kernel.idempotency` **remains forbidden under
`app/`**. There is no sanctioned facade over the model for a new owner
command to call instead — the only way to get replay-safety for
`offer_access_requirement`'s admission command today is the same
hand-rolled pattern the other 32 callers already use. Extracting a shared
facade now would itself have to import `IdempotencyKey`/`TaskExecution` and
would simply move the same reference into a new file, tripping this exact
ratchet without removing the underlying coexistence.

**Retirement.** This entry is coexistence debt, not a permanent grant. It
must be retired — removed from `idempotency_legacy_callers.txt` in the same
reviewed slice that migrates `offer_access_requirement`'s admission
idempotency off the local `IdempotencyKey` model — at the eventual kernel
idempotency cutover described by ADR-0011's amendment (pinned
exact-tagged kernel/module artifacts, composed plane, fresh/predecessor
upgrade and RLS proof, then a shadow/parity phase before any writer moves).
