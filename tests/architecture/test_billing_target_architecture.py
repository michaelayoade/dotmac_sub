"""Ratchet new work toward the ADR 0007 end-to-end billing target.

ADR 0007 is accepted but its migration phases have not cut over. These guards
do not claim the target is in place. They freeze the patterns the target
retires so a change cannot add another instance while the phases land:

- mutable money counters standing in for derived position (invariants 12, 13);
- metadata/JSON deciding financial identity or treatment (invariant 4);
- scheduled business-wide financial sweeps (invariant 18, section 7).

Each baseline is shrink-only. Removing debt means deleting the line, never
raising the count.
