"""Every staff-facing API route must declare an authorization guard.

The router-mount mode "user" only attaches ``require_user_auth`` — it proves
the caller is *some* authenticated principal, INCLUDING a customer subscriber.
A staff/admin endpoint mounted that way with no ``require_permission`` is open
to any logged-in customer. This test reconstructs the FULL production API
surface — both the core routers (mounted at import) and the DEFERRED routers
(mounted in the lifespan startup, e.g. settings, qualification) — and fails
the build on any ``/api/v1`` route that lacks a permission/role guard, unless
its path is on the self-scoped allowlist below.

Building from the spec lists (not the live ``app.routes``) is deliberate: the
deferred routers are NOT on ``app`` until startup runs, so an ``app.routes``
walk would silently skip exactly the routers most likely to be misconfigured.

RBAC-coverage counterpart of ``test_thin_wrappers``: makes the "forgot the
permission dependency" class of bug build-failing rather than shippable.
