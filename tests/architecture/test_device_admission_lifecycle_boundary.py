"""Device admission is a single owned transition, and it stays that way.

``network.monitoring_inventory`` owns the ``NetworkDevice`` admission
lifecycle. Every deactivation must go through ``set_network_device_active`` so
the derived reachability cache is decayed with it; a caller that writes the
flag directly reintroduces the frozen-``up`` defect (a device that leaves the
poll sweep keeps asserting reachability forever, which vetoes outage detection
for every customer behind it).

These are static checks: they fail when a new caller reaches around the owner.
