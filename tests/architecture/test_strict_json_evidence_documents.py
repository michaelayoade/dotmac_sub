r"""Every strict-JSON evidence document under docs/ must parse as JSON.

Michael's ruling on this repair: "strict JSON evidence files must be outside
Ruff's formatting ownership, while their validator runs after formatting and
fails on invalid JSON. Don't 'fix' this by accepting Ruff-formatted
pseudo-JSON."

``ruff format`` rewrites ``docs/kernel-runtime-composition.json`` into
pseudo-JSON with a trailing comma before the closing ``}``/``]`` — confirmed
directly against this repository (copy the file, run ``ruff format`` on the
copy, and ``json.load`` the result: ``json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Illegal
trailing comma before end of object``). ``docs/kernel-runtime-readiness.json``,
untouched by the change that added this test, shows the identical
"Would reformat" from ``ruff format --check`` — this is pre-existing and
formatter-shaped, not specific to one document's content.

The repair has two parts. ``pyproject.toml``'s ``[tool.ruff] extend-exclude``
and ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``'s per-hook ``exclude:`` (a directory-walk
exclude does not help against a pre-commit hook that passes a changed file's
exact path) keep the formatter off both documents entirely. THIS test is the
other half: it runs ``json.load`` directly against both documents and fails,
naming the path, on any parse error — so if the formatter's exclusion is ever
removed or bypassed, this test (not a human reading a diff) is what catches
the corruption. Order matters: this must run as part of the normal test
suite, never a "does ruff accept it" check that a corrupting formatter step
could run before and mask.

This module and the ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` "Strict-JSON evidence
documents parse after formatting" step are complementary for a THIRD reason,
beyond the two already recorded in that step's comment (formatter-in-this-
run vs. arrived-broken-by-any-route): the workflow step is skippable BY
CONFIGURATION in a way this test is not. The `changes` job's docs-only
classifier (`grep -Ev '^(docs/|.*\.md$)'`) treats a PR that changes only
``docs/kernel-runtime-composition.json`` as docs-only, and every OTHER step
in the same `lint` job is guarded off on a docs-only change — so a workflow
maintainer "tidying up" an apparently-inconsistent guard could reattach
`if: needs.changes.outputs.docs-only != 'true'` to that one step and silence
it on precisely the PRs most likely to corrupt the record it protects, while
every other CI signal stays green. This module has no such knob: it runs
whenever the `architecture` test job runs, full stop, with no path-based
classifier able to skip it.
`test_the_ci_strict_json_step_is_not_gated_on_docs_only` below additionally
pins that the workflow step itself carries no `docs-only` guard, so a
reintroduced guard is caught here too, not only by a human reading the
workflow file.
