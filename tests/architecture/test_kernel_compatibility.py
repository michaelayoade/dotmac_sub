"""The pinned dotmac-kernel wheel is compatible with Sub, and stays contained.

Slice S2 of the selective kernel-adoption plan
(docs/PLATFORM_ADOPTION_LEDGER.md) pinned the wheel while Sub's runtime stayed
UNCHANGED. That is no longer the state and this file says so rather than
asserting a claim it has outgrown: the settings cutover made
``app/services/settings_spec.py`` register Sub's specs with
``dotmac_kernel.settings_resolver`` and resolve through it, so Sub now CONSUMES
the kernel rather than merely depending on it.

What this file proves, with zero skips:

- every ledger-allowlisted pure surface (and the tests/-only test kit) imports
  in a subprocess with ``DATABASE_URL`` and all DB-ish env stripped — the
  "testing is DB-free" claim is exercised, not assumed;
- the installed distribution is exactly the reviewed pin and ships ``py.typed``;
- ``pyproject.toml`` pins the kernel EXACTLY (no ``^``/``~``/``>=``/``*``
  range) from the named private index — an unreviewed range upgrade is a CI
  failure, not a lockfile surprise;
- the pure value contracts behave (exact ``Decimal`` money, float rejection,
  provisioning protocol/result types, assembly/feature/capability/profile
  specs, the reusable provider contract check);
- the Sub app builds with the kernel installed, and every ``dotmac_kernel``
  module in its import graph is one the ledger allowlist admits OR one the
  kernel reaches for itself (``TRANSITIVE_KERNEL_MODULES``, a reviewed
  snapshot — twenty-six of them, which is worth knowing) — and no kernel
  middleware is mounted, no kernel route endpoint is served, and the top-level
  route prefix set is exactly the reviewed pin.

The containment that matters is unchanged: ``dotmac_kernel.deps``,
``.middleware``, ``.audit`` and the rest stay out of ``app/`` entirely, and a
side-door import of one fails here even though the AST guard cannot see it.

``dotmac_kernel.testing`` usage stays confined to ``tests/`` per the ledger;
this file is itself test-side and imports kernel modules freely (the S1 guard
covers ``app/`` only).

#: — precisely the surfaces the adoption ledger keeps out of `app/`. Nothing in
#: `app/` imports them and the AST guard still refuses one that tries; they are
#: here because `settings_resolver` reaches them internally.
#:
#: The a50 -> a81 repin added five names, each traced to an ALLOWED import
#: rather than absorbed: `planes` and `prerequisites` arrive through
#: `assembly`/`modules` (the ADR-0028 explicit plane contract), `external_identity`
#: through `models` (kernel revision 0024's binding table), `outbox_event_types`
#: through `features`, and the private `_transactions` through the a73 change
#: that stopped consent/delivery/idempotency/external-identity importing the
#: eager kernel database owner just to open a SAVEPOINT. None of them is an
#: authority Sub consults, and none is reachable from `app/`.
#: The a81 -> a90 repin adds `machine_auth` and `machine_models`; they are
#: loaded by the kernel's machine-credential facility but are not direct Sub
#: imports and mount no runtime surface in `app.main`.
#:
#: Being LOADED is not being USED: a module in `sys.modules` creates no second
#: authority, mounts no route, and answers no question Sub asks. The sibling
#: test below proves that separately, on middleware and routes. But the cost of
#: adoption is not "one module" and this list is what stops that being a
#: comfortable assumption.
#:
#: This is a reviewed snapshot, like `EXPECTED_ROUTE_PREFIXES`. A NEW name
#: appearing means the kernel started reaching somewhere new, which is a thing
#: to look at rather than absorb. It is NOT a licence for `app/` to import any
#: of these — that list is `ALLOWED_KERNEL_MODULES`, and it is the boundary.
