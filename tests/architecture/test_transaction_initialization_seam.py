"""`SET TRANSACTION` cannot be the first statement, so it must not be used.

`SET TRANSACTION` — in every spelling, isolation level or bare `READ ONLY` — is
only legal as the FIRST statement in a transaction. Since #2353 installs
`app.current_tenant` via `set_config` on `after_begin`, it never is: a statement
has always run before any caller SQL arrives. Twenty-four read-only operator
reports and one serializable writer raised ActiveSqlTransaction on every
PostgreSQL invocation, while SQLite unit coverage stayed green because it skips
the dialect branch entirely.

The repair is two seams in the transaction-authority layer. This guard stops the
raw pattern coming back, in two ways the first version of it could not:

- It matches `SET TRANSACTION` rather than `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`.
  The narrower pattern was itself a half-repair: it certified thirteen callers
  while twenty-three uses of the bare `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY` spelling sat
  outside its reach, equally broken and equally invisible.
- The exemption is a CHECKED PREMISE, not a list of filenames. A module holding
  a raw `Connection` from its own engine has no ORM session, so no `after_begin`
  hook runs and `SET TRANSACTION` genuinely is its first statement. That is true
  of the CRM import/drift scripts, which speak to a second database entirely.
  The guard re-derives that per file instead of trusting a name, so one of them
  adopting an ORM session is caught the moment it does.

Scanning is over string literals rather than raw text, so prose explaining the
defect — this docstring included — is not itself a violation. That is why the
guard needs no allowlist at all.
