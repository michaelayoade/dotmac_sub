"""Sub's `SecretSource` — what it loads, and how it fails.

The behaviour that matters is the failure path. `dotmac_kernel.secret_sources`
treats a successful return as the COMPLETE set of secrets this deployment holds,
so a source that returns partially, or empty, when OpenBao is unreachable would
have the kernel install that as success — and every consumer would then see
"not configured" rather than "could not reach the store".

Sub has two OpenBao readers and only one is safe here: `resolve_openbao_ref`
raises, `get_secret` swallows every exception and returns a default. Using the
convenient one would be the bug.

    A name lands here only when its material belongs to ONE feature, so a

    value stops the boot.

    `machine_credential_hmac_key` (added 2026-08-24) qualifies under exactly
    that rule, and only while the migration is in flight: no machine credential
    has been minted, the legacy `api_keys` verifier still answers, so a
    deployment without the key has a dormant feature rather than a fault.

    It is deliberately NOT required TODAY, even though the kernel has no
    fallback. Requiring it would mean a deploy that reached the registry before
    the operator reached OpenBao takes the whole application down over a feature
    with zero rows.

    It MOVES to the required set — and the `_machine_principal` gate that reads
    it is deleted — in the change that retires the legacy branch. There machine
    auth is the only way an integration authenticates, absence stops being
    dormant and becomes every integration failing closed, and a boot that
    refuses is correct. This assertion is what will fail and force that move to
    be deliberate rather than forgotten.
