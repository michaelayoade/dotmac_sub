"""Two-directional ratchet on the cohort-isp-01 source writer surface.

Governance cohort 1 — party, customers and brand profiles — will eventually
move to `asm-dotmac-isp`. Before that can be considered, the set of Sub code
that writes those facts has to be known and has to stop growing. This guard
does exactly that and nothing more: it records today's writers and fails on
movement in either direction.

Both directions matter, for different reasons.

*Upward* is the obvious one: a new writer added while the cutover is being
prepared is a writer nobody planned to displace, and it will be discovered
after the authority switch rather than before.

*Downward* matters because a ratchet that silently absorbs removals can be
spent twice. If a writer disappears and the baseline still claims it, the
budget for "one more writer" is quietly restored, and the next addition passes
a guard that should have caught it. So a removal is a failure until the same
change lowers the line — which is the pull request that actually retired the
writer, after the sealed switch, never in advance.

## Sensitivity

Every rejection test here is paired with a proof that the same code path
admits the legal case, and the whole-repository sweeps assert against a
*constructed* violation in a synthetic tree rather than only over today's
data. A guard that has only ever seen conforming input passes for the wrong
reason: it would keep passing if the detector it exercises were deleted.
