"""Pin `collection_accounts` as the single owner of a Dotmac receiving account.

Before this boundary existed the same bank account lived in four places: the
`billing.direct_bank_transfer_accounts` JSON settings blob, the legacy singular
`direct_bank_transfer_*` keys, the `company_bank_*` company-info fields used as an
invoice fallback, and this table. Presentment read the settings while attribution
read the table, so the account shown to a customer was a dict parsed from a string
with no identity to record on the resulting payment — which is why "which of our
accounts received this money?" could not be answered.

These tests fail if a new reader reintroduces one of the retired copies.
