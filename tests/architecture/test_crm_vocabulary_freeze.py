"""The CRM/Omni surface is frozen while it is being replaced domain by domain.

The `dotmac_crm` deployment ("Omni") was decommissioned 2026-08-29. What
remains inside Sub is replaced one domain at a time — Inbox/Chat, then
Support/Ticketing, Sales/Quotes, Party/Customer/Reseller, ERP modules, and
finally secrets/deployment/observability — each slice deleting residue BESIDE
its replacement owner rather than in a sweep.

That only works if the surface holds still between slices, and this is what
holds it. It is deliberately two-directional:

* A **new** CRM or Omni dependency must not land while the programme runs.
* An **existing** one must not vanish silently. Every removal lowers the
  baseline in the same change, which is what turns the programme into a
  sequence of recorded decisions instead of a diff nobody can audit.

The falling direction is the one people find surprising, so it is worth being
explicit: yes, deleting CRM code fails this guard. That is the guard working.
Lower the baseline in the same commit and it passes.
