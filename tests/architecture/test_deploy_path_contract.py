"""Production code reaches a host only as a registry-built image.

``scripts/deploy.sh`` is the production deployment owner (see
``docs/runbooks/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md``): it deploys one immutable GHCR
image with backup, OCI-revision validation, health gates and rollback. Every
other path onto a prod box is a deliberate, explicitly-acknowledged fallback.

These tests pin the two properties that kept regressing:

- ``docker-compose.yml`` must not carry a ``build:`` stanza. GenieACS was the
  last one; it forced every prod host to keep a full application checkout,
  which is how working trees drifted onto feature branches for days.
- The legacy Makefile paths that bypass ``scripts/deploy.sh`` must refuse to
  run without their explicit opt-in variables, and the supported ``deploy``
  target must still delegate to the deploy script.
