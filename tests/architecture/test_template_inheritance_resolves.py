"""Every literal ``extends``/``include`` target must exist.

Jinja resolves ``{% extends %}`` at RENDER time, not import time, so a template
naming a base that does not exist raises ``TemplateNotFound`` as a 500 on the
first real request and is invisible to every import-time or route-registration
check.

Regression: four admin templates extended ``admin/base.html``, which has never
existed in this repo. `/admin/vendors/operations`, the two vendor review
confirmations, and the provisioning service-change reconciliation page all
returned HTTP 500 in production until a browser smoke crawl hit one of them.
