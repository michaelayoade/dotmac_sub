"""Governance: high-impact editors carry contracts or conscious waivers.

HIGH_IMPACT_EDITORS is the checked-in configuration listing every editor whose
submit moves money, changes service, or is irreversible. Each entry must be
"contracted" (with a registered FormContract), "waived" (with a reason), or
"pending" (reported, tolerated — adoption owed on touch per the design review
checklist). Contracts register through form_contracts.register() next to their
command owners.
