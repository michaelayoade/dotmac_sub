"""A mutating route must be guarded by a WRITE-tier permission, not a read one.

``test_admin_web_route_guards`` and ``test_route_permission_guards`` both ask
only "is there a guard?" — their ``_GUARD_NAMES`` sets match on the dependency
CALLABLE's name, and ``require_permission("router:read")`` and
``require_permission("router:write")`` produce the same callable name
(``_require_permission``). So a ``:read`` permission on a POST satisfied both
tests. That is how ``POST /admin/network/routers/new`` (``create_router``) and
``POST /admin/network/routers/{router_id}/edit`` (``update_router``) shipped
guarded by nothing but a router-level ``router:read``, alongside siblings in the
same file that correctly used ``router:write``.

This test closes that CLASS. For every mutating route on the staff surfaces
(``/admin`` and ``/api/v1``) it resolves the route's effective permission floor
and fails the build unless at least one guard demands a permission that is not
read-tier.

Three properties make it actually bite:

1. **The guard set is the UNION of route-level, router-level and mount-point
   dependencies.** FastAPI flattens all three into ``route.dependant``, and this
   test reads that tree rather than the decorator. A per-route source scan
   cannot see ``APIRouter(dependencies=[...])`` — which is precisely the shape
   the ``network_routers`` defect had (no route-level guard at all), and the
   shape ``POST /api/v1/geocode/preview`` still has (its only permission comes
   from the ``readperm:`` mount mode in ``app.main``).
2. **It walks the MOUNT TABLE, not one router object.** The surface is rebuilt
   from ``_CORE_ROUTER_SPECS`` + ``_DEFERRED_API_ROUTER_SPECS`` through the real
   ``_mount_router``. ``app.web.admin.network_routers`` used to be mounted
   out-of-band under ``/admin`` — where ``_mount_router`` drops mount
   dependencies entirely — so it received no staff baseline and neither
   architecture test could see it. A router that is mounted is audited, however
   it got there.
3. **Read-tier is decided by the VERB SEGMENT, matched segment-exactly.**
   ``"foo:read_write"`` is a write; ``"foo:read"`` is a read. Substring matching
   would get that backwards. A permission whose verb is in NEITHER vocabulary
   below fails the build rather than passing silently — a new verb must be
   classified deliberately.

Scope: this test audits routes that carry at least one permission guard and asks
whether that guard is strong enough. Routes with NO permission guard at all are
the sibling tests' subject (both keep their own empty ``_KNOWN_UNGUARDED``
quarantines and self-scoped allowlists); together the three cover the surface.

    Tiering a route depends on ``permission_requirement()`` being able to read

    a ``PermissionRequirement`` onto the dependency it returns. A NEW factory
    added without the stamp would not make this gate fail — it would make the
