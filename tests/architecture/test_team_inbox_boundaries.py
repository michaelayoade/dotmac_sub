"""Architecture guard: the team-inbox owner family is the only inbox writer.

The contracted ``communications.team_inbox_*`` family owns all
inbox ORM mutations. Everything else — API webhooks, admin web routes, tasks,
other services — must go through the family's entrypoints
(``team_inbox_commands`` for admin mutations, ``*_committed`` receivers for
ingest). A new module that imports inbox models for writing is a parallel
writer and fails here.

The check is intentionally blunt: any ``app/`` module outside the allowed set
that instantiates an inbox model class or references it in an ORM-write
context (``db.add(Inbox…)``, ``update(Inbox…)``, ``delete(Inbox…)``,
``insert(Inbox…)``) is flagged. Read-only usage (``select``/``query`` for
projections) stays free.
