"""Deployment Control's `ModuleManifest` — the sixteenth stateful module.

Must match `DEPLOYMENT_CONTROL_MIGRATION_OWNER` in the kernel ledger exactly or
`NamespaceRegistry.from_manifests` refuses the composition at boot:
`short_code="deploy"` -> `mod_deploy`, `migration_prefix="dc"` -> `dc_0001_...`,
`migration_branch="deployment_control"`, and `platform_tables` bounding what the
composed gate will accept the migration creating.

## Platform plane only, and the reason is close to tautological

A module that decides what a fleet of deployments should run cannot live inside
one of those deployments. `tables=()` is a DECLARATION (ADR-0023 rejects
inferring a plane from a missing `tenant_id`), and ADR-0057 § 7 derives it from
the one consumer that exists today: the vendor control plane.

The deployments themselves are separate applications. They learn what to do
through the Integrator and report back through a signed envelope the kernel
verifies (ADR-0007) — never by reading this schema (ADR-0024).

## Four audit actions, split by SUBJECT

`deployment.target.changed`, `deployment.credential.changed`,
`deployment.rollout.changed`, `deployment.observation.recorded`.

Split by subject rather than by verb, because an operator reading an audit trail
is asking one of four genuinely different questions: did the fleet's INTENT
change, did a deployment's IDENTITY change, did we DECIDE to roll something out,
or did a deployment TELL us something? Collapsing them would make each of those
require opening every detail blob; splitting per verb would put the lifecycle in
two places and let the manifest and the enums drift.

Contrast `dotmac-commercial-agreements`, which declares exactly one because every
transition there is the same actor doing the same kind of thing.

## Two logical prerequisites, both written at REQUEST time

Neither is created by this module's own migrations, and an undeclared runtime
dependency is still a dependency — it just has no DDL to betray it.

- Every command delegates at-most-once to the kernel (hard rule 23, ADR-0014),
  writing `public.platform_idempotency_records`.
- Every command writes `public.platform_audit_events` inside the same operation.

COMMON rather than `platform_requires`: this module has exactly one plane, so the
declared platform plane installs atomically and there is no selection under which
the requirement could lapse.
