"""Runtime-readiness inventory: a two-directional ratchet on local
engine/session construction outside `app.db`'s canonical `SessionLocal`.

This is characterization, not a cutover guard: Sub still owns its own
database/session authority (`app/db.py`), and nothing here adopts
`dotmac_kernel.session_runtime.DatabaseRuntime` or changes a pinned version.
Its only job is to make sure the inventory this ratchet backs
(`docs/sub-runtime-readiness-inventory.md`) cannot silently drift — a new
construction site the Kernel runtime-composition seam would need to account
for must be a reviewed, deliberate baseline edit, not an unnoticed diff.

Mirrors the existing `test_adapter_keyword_service_calls.py` two-directional
shape: grow-or-appear fails immediately; shrink-without-lowering-the-baseline
also fails, so the debt figure stays trustworthy in both directions.

#: Aggregate, informational count of construction sites under `tests/`.
#: Deliberately NOT a per-file baseline: test fixtures legitimately construct
#: one ad hoc engine per test, and per-file churn there says nothing about
#: runtime readiness. This total is still two-directional so a wholesale
#: change in how tests touch the database (e.g. every fixture switching to a
#: new async pattern) cannot pass unnoticed either.
#: +2 from tests/integration/test_integration_inbox_concurrency.py: two new
#: two-session Postgres concurrency tests for the payment-inbox lease
#: (reclaim-vs-reclaim and reclaim-vs-completion), each with its own
#: `sessionmaker`, mirroring the file's existing test fixture pattern.
#: +2 from tests/integration/test_auth_session_refresh_concurrency.py: the
#: setup/verification factory and two concurrent owner-command sessions.
#: +1 from tests/integration/test_tr069_active_cpe_identity_concurrency.py:
#: a concurrent-write proof for migration 595_active_cpe_identity's new
#: partial unique index (two sessions racing to activate the same
#: cpe_device_id), reviewed test-fixture authorship for the CPE identity
#: cardinality program.
#: +1 from tests/integration/test_prepaid_funding_trigger_execution_rollback.py:
#: a real-Postgres two-connection proof that a forced failure in the
#: funding-consequence owner's own transaction rolls back only that
#: transaction, following the established two-real-connection pattern.
#: +2 from tests/integration/test_prepaid_renewal_nightly_isolation.py: two
#: real-Postgres tests (ambiguous-account isolation, unclassified-failure
#: abort) each with their own `sessionmaker`, driving the single-owner
#: funding-consequence fix through the real nightly entry point.
