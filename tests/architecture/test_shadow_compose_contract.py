"""The shadow stack may not acquire power it has no business having.

Every test here comes in a pair: the shipped file is compliant, and the detector
that proves it *bites* when the property is removed. A hardening test that only
ever sees a hardened file is indistinguishable from a hardening test that has
been silently broken — it passes either way. So each check mutates the parsed
model to construct the exact violation and asserts the detector names it.

Mutation is done with `model_copy(update=...)`, which deliberately skips
validation: the point is to build a file that *should not exist* and prove the
contract rejects it.
