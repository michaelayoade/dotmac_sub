"""A fact the kernel owns has exactly ONE expression under ``app/``.

Every defect the settings cutover surfaced was the same one wearing different
clothes: a fact belonging to `dotmac_kernel` restated locally, then drifting.

- the native ``settingvaluetype`` enum restated the value-type registry, so a
  kernel-declared type could not be stored (migration 512);
- ``CHECK (value_type = 'json' AND ...)`` restated ``ValueTypeSpec.storage``,
  and blocked the column conversion that removed the enum;
- ``DomainSettingUpdate`` and ``DomainSettingCreate`` restated it AGAIN one
  layer up, so a setting whose value is an array could not be written through
  the API at all — found only because a test happened to write one;
- ``SettingsCache`` restated the key model and dropped the scope segment, which
  is the cross-tenant leak `dotmac_kernel.settings_cache` names ERP for.

Four instances, one rule. Reviewing harder does not close that class; a test
does. This file is that test, and it is meant to grow one case per kernel-owned
fact rather than to stay as it is.

The rule it enforces today: **which column a value type is stored in is a
property of the TYPE**, held in `dotmac_kernel.setting_value_types` as
``ValueTypeSpec.storage``. Exactly one place under ``app/`` may ask; nobody may
answer for themselves by naming a type.
