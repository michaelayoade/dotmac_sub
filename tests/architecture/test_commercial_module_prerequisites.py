#: PostgreSQL allows `$` as an identifier CONTINUATION character (never as
#: the first character, but that distinction doesn't matter for a boundary
#: check that only asks "is this still the same identifier"), so
#: `dotmac_ro$archive` is a single, legitimate, DISTINCT PostgreSQL
#: identifier — not `dotmac_ro` followed by something else — and `$`
#: immediately adjacent to the needle must suppress the match, not merely
#: `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.
#:
#: This boundary is DELIBERATELY ASCII-ONLY — it does NOT also exclude
#: non-ASCII bytes, even though PostgreSQL's grammar also accepts non-ASCII
#: LETTERS as identifier continuation characters (so `dotmac_roé` is,
#: strictly, also one legitimate distinct identifier). An earlier version
#: of this boundary treated EVERY non-ASCII byte as a continuation
#: character to close that gap, and that was a worse defect than the one it
#: fixed: prose next to the needle is not always plain ASCII — a curly
#: quote, an em-dash, or a non-breaking space in a Markdown document (the
#: guard's own retirement documents are exactly this kind of prose) are
#: each encoded with a byte in `\x80-\xff`, and treating that byte as a
#: continuation character made a REAL occurrence of `dotmac_ro` sitting
#: next to one of them silently UNDETECTED. Distinguishing a non-ASCII
#: LETTER from non-ASCII punctuation at the byte level, without decoding,
#: is not practical. Between over-reporting (`dotmac_roé` wrongly flagged —
#: `$` is in the boundary class and correctly suppresses `dotmac_ro$archive`,
#: but a non-ASCII LETTER is not, so this is the actual accepted
#: over-report: a visible annoyance a human resolves in a minute) and
#: under-reporting (a real reference silently never flagged — the exact
#: failure this whole guard exists to prevent), THIS GUARD MUST
#: OVER-REPORT. Do not re-narrow this boundary to non-ASCII bytes without

def _byte_needle_patterns(needle: str) -> tuple[re.Pattern[bytes], ...]:
    """Case-insensitive BYTE patterns for a role-identifier needle — ONE of
    the three is word-boundary-aware, the other two deliberately are not.

    This is a LITERAL-IDENTIFIER RATCHET, not a proof of absence: it catches
    the literal string `dotmac_ro` appearing in a tracked file's RAW BYTES,
    in any of three covered patterns across two encodings, as a standalone
    identifier ONLY in the ASCII/UTF-8 case — the two UTF-16 patterns match
    the encoded needle unconditionally, with no standalone-identifier check
    at all (see below for why). It does not, and cannot, prove the absence
    of a constructed or obfuscated reference — string concatenation, base64
    or other encoding, an environment-variable name that only resolves to
    `dotmac_ro` at runtime, unicode homoglyphs, and similar evasions are
    all outside what this pattern can see.

    Matching happens against each file's RAW BYTES, never after decoding to
    `str`, and needs no assumption about a file's text encoding: it applies
    identically to a `.py` source file and to this repository's 156 tracked
    binary assets (images, fonts) — a SQLite fixture, a compiled catalog, a
    PDF, an object file, or an archived export can all carry the literal
    bytes `dotmac_ro`, and this scan finds them exactly as it would in a
    `.py` file. There is no binary exemption: "a binary file cannot
    meaningfully contain this identifier" is an assumption, not an
    enforceable premise, and a byte-level scan removes the need to make it.

    The enforceable premise is which ENCODINGS are covered, not which files
    are scanned — exactly two, and no others (not UTF-32, not EBCDIC, not a
    custom obfuscation):

    - **ASCII/UTF-8** — `dotmac_ro`, `DOTMAC_RO`, or any mixed-cased
      spelling, byte-for-byte (PostgreSQL folds an unquoted identifier to
      lowercase, but a quoted identifier or a comment can carry any case).
    - **UTF-16, both byte orders** — each ASCII character interleaved with a
      null byte (`d\x00o\x00t\x00...` little-endian, or the reverse for
      big-endian), matching how a UTF-16-encoded SQL script or export would
      carry the same identifier.

    A plain substring match on `dotmac_ro` also fires inside unrelated
    identifiers that merely happen to start with those characters —
    `dotmac_router_ssh` (a real docker-compose volume/service name) and
    `dotmac_roles_r1_...` (a real test-generated role prefix) both contain
    `dotmac_ro` as a substring without naming this role. In the ASCII/UTF-8
    pattern ONLY, requiring that the needle not be preceded or followed by
    another ASCII identifier CONTINUATION character (`[A-Za-z0-9_$]`) on
    either side rules those out, while still matching standalone
    `dotmac_ro`, quoted/backtick-quoted forms, and any differently-cased
    spelling. The UTF-16 patterns have NO such requirement and WILL flag
    either collision shape if it appears UTF-16-encoded — see below for
    why.

    The ASCII/UTF-8 boundary is deliberately ASCII-only — see
    `_ASCII_IDENTIFIER_BOUNDARY_BYTES`'s comment for why treating non-ASCII
    bytes as boundary characters was tried and reverted: it silently
    stopped detecting a real occurrence sitting next to ordinary prose
    punctuation (a curly quote, an em-dash, a non-breaking space), which is
    a FAR worse failure than the narrower over-reporting this guard accepts
    instead. Concretely: `dotmac_ro$archive` is correctly NOT flagged (`$`
    is in the ASCII boundary class), but `dotmac_roé` IS flagged — the
    guard reports the `dotmac_ro` prefix inside it as a match, even though
    `dotmac_roé` is, strictly, one legitimate distinct PostgreSQL
    identifier. That is a visible, quickly-resolved false positive, chosen
    deliberately over a silent miss.

    The UTF-16 patterns (both byte orders) have NO boundary check at all —
    see `_utf16_pattern`'s docstring for why a boundary lookaround is
    actively unsafe there, not just imprecise.

    ACCEPTED RESIDUAL RISK, stated explicitly rather than silently carried:
    the ASCII/UTF-8 pattern operates on raw bytes with no awareness of
    whether the surrounding file is actually UTF-16, so it can — in
    principle — match ACROSS a pair of UTF-16 code-unit boundaries when
    unrelated multi-byte characters happen to align to the exact needle
    bytes (e.g. five specific UTF-16BE CJK-range code points whose sixteen
    raw bytes happen to spell `dotmac_ro `). This is a FALSE POSITIVE risk,
    not a false negative, and it is NOT suppressed by first classifying a
    file as "is this UTF-16" and skipping the ASCII pattern there: no
    reliable, BOM-independent way to make that classification exists
    (a UTF-16 file need carry no BOM at all), and reintroducing per-file
    text-encoding classification is exactly the kind of assumption this
    design deliberately avoids elsewhere (see `_files_containing`'s
    docstring on the binary-file exemption it removed for the same reason).
    The residual risk is accepted as-is: this ratchet already discloses
    that it is not a proof of absence, and an accidental sixteen-byte
    coincidence spelling the exact needle is a vanishingly unlikely way for

        This has NO boundary check, unlike the ASCII/UTF-8 pattern above,

        lookaround assumes the needle's code units are the ones actually
        aligned in the file, but nothing about a raw byte scan can know a
        UTF-16 payload's alignment relative to file offset zero. A genuine
        occurrence starting at an ODD offset shifts every neighboring
        "code unit" the lookaround would inspect by one byte, so it
        inspects the wrong bytes entirely — not "imprecisely," but
        WRONGLY, and in a way that can SUPPRESS a real match. Concretely,
        `b"!A\\x00" + <needle in UTF-16LE> + b"A"` defeats a boundary
        check in both directions at once: the LE lookaround sees the
        preceding `A\\x00` as if it were an ASCII identifier character
        (it is actually the unrelated preceding byte `!` and the needle's
        own first byte, misaligned), and the trailing `\\x00A` likewise
        looks like a following identifier character to the BE lookaround
        computed over the same bytes. Two earlier, narrower fixes to this
        boundary (non-ASCII-inclusive, then ASCII-only) each closed one
        false-negative shape and left this one: a boundary check that
        cannot know its own alignment is not a boundary check, it is a
        source of silent misses.

        The trade is the same one already accepted for the ASCII/UTF-8
        pattern's non-letter case, taken further: this pattern matches the
        encoded needle UNCONDITIONALLY, with no adjacent-character check
        at all. It WILL flag `dotmac_router_ssh` or `dotmac_roles_r1_...`
        if either appears UTF-16-encoded — a real over-report, wider than
        the ASCII pattern's. That is accepted deliberately: this guard
        must over-report rather than under-report, and a UTF-16-encoded
        collision with either known decoy shape has never once appeared
        in this repository's actual tracked content in any round of this

    operational runbook is a real control surface (one could legitimately
    reference a role-grant procedure and should be guarded, not
    blanket-exempted for being Markdown), and so is every other test file.
    Both are now scanned like any other tracked file.

    A directory allowlist was an even earlier design and it structurally
    cannot keep up: it silently missed `.github/actions/setup-ci-python/
    action.yml`, `config/freeradius/schema.sql`, and
    `config/freeradius/sql/admin_schema.sql` — all real, tracked,
    unscanned surfaces. Selecting every tracked file minus the three
    documented self-referencing exclusions has no such PATH-SELECTION blind
    spot by construction.

    THE LESSON THIS FUNCTION EXISTS TO RECORD: a tracked path has TWO
    sources of truth, not one — the git INDEX, which declares what the
    path IS (mode `100644` ordinary file, `120000` symlink, `160000`
    gitlink/submodule, ...), and the WORKING TREE, which is whatever
    currently happens to sit on disk at that path. `_read_verified_tracked_bytes`
    asks the filesystem: it refuses a symlinked ancestor, a dangling
    target, a FIFO, a non-regular leaf — every one of those is a DISK-STATE
    check, made by actually opening path components with `O_NOFOLLOW`. But
    a disk-state check can only see what is currently on disk. If a
    tracked symlink or gitlink has been locally replaced by an ORDINARY
    regular file, the disk-state walk sees a perfectly normal file and
    scans it — it never learns that the INDEX declares this path to be
    something this guard must refuse, because the index is a different
    source of truth that a disk-only walk never reads. This function reads
    the index (`_tracked_files_with_modes`, `git ls-files --stage -z`) and
    refuses a prohibited mode (`_PROHIBITED_INDEX_MODES`) HERE, at target
    selection, before `_read_verified_tracked_bytes` or anything else
    reads a single byte from disk — closing the half of this guard's
    completeness that a disk-only walk structurally cannot reach. The next
    person strengthening this guard should check both sources, not just
    the one already checked.

    This function still makes no claim about whether a selected path's
    CONTENT can be safely read from disk — that remains
    `_files_containing`'s enforceable-premise contract (no symlinks or
    non-regular files ENCOUNTERED on disk, no missing paths; a violation
    refuses rather than silently skips). It also makes no claim about text
    encoding for file CONTENT, because `_files_containing` scans raw bytes
    and needs no such assumption — but it does refuse a non-UTF-8 tracked
    FILENAME itself, via `_tracked_files_with_modes`.

    A stat-then-read check on the LEAF alone (`path.is_symlink()` followed
    later by `path.read_bytes()`) has real gaps:

    - It only inspects the leaf. If a tracked directory such as `scripts/`
      is replaced in the worktree by a symlink to a DIFFERENT directory
      holding same-named regular files, the leaf itself is not a symlink,
      `exists()`/`is_file()` succeed by following the parent, and the old
      code would silently scan the SUBSTITUTE content — the actual tracked
      content is neither scanned nor refused.
    - It has a check/read race: a leaf replaced between the `is_symlink()`
      check and the later `read_bytes()` call has the same effect.
    - Blocking `open()` on a leaf that is actually a FIFO with no writer
      hangs forever, never even reaching a type check — a guard that hangs
      produces no verdict at all, which is worse than one that refuses.

    This closes all three by opening every path component, INCLUDING
    `root` itself, from `root` down to the leaf with `O_NOFOLLOW`
    (directories additionally with `O_DIRECTORY`, and the leaf additionally
    with `O_NONBLOCK` so opening a FIFO cannot block), chained via `dir_fd`
    so each `open` resolves strictly relative to the previous, already-open
    directory — a symlink ANYWHERE in the chain makes that `open` fail
    outright (`ELOOP`) rather than silently following it. The leaf is then
    checked and read from that SAME file descriptor, so there is no window
    between "validated" and "read" for something else to swap the content
    out from under the scan: what is checked is exactly what is read,
    because it is the same open file.

    Genuine premise violations — this scan genuinely cannot read the
    committed content in each case — REFUSE loudly rather than silently
    skipping or hanging: a symlink anywhere in the chain (including `root`
    itself), a missing tracked path, or a non-regular leaf (a
    gitlink/submodule directory, or a FIFO/device/socket substituted for a
    tracked file, are the concrete cases: `git ls-files` lists a path, but
    there is no ordinary file content behind it to read).

    STATED RESIDUAL PREMISE, not closed and not silently assumed away: this
    walk does not detect a SAME-TYPE ancestor substitution racing it — an
    already-validated ancestor directory renamed away and replaced by
    ANOTHER ordinary directory between that component's `open()` and the
    next component's `open()` is indistinguishable from the original at
    the point of the second `open()`, because both are ordinary,
    non-symlink directories and neither `O_NOFOLLOW` nor a `dir_fd` chain
    can see past that. Closing this at reasonable cost is not possible
    without a broader filesystem-level guarantee (e.g. an immutable
    checkout) this test suite does not control. What IS enforced — a
    symlinked or non-regular component anywhere in the chain — covers the
    concrete tampering shape this guard was written to catch; a
    same-type-substitution race is a different, narrower threat left
    explicitly open rather than implicitly assumed closed.

    the three files in `_DOTMAC_RO_SELF_REFERENCING_FILES`
    (this guard test file, ADR-0016, and its companion runbook), each of
    which must itself name `dotmac_ro` to describe and forbid it, and which
    this test asserts are EXACTLY those three via a literal written
    independently of that tuple. Every OTHER test file and every OTHER
    Markdown document — including other docs and other runbooks — is a real
    control surface and IS scanned: an earlier version of this guard
    exempted all of `tests/` and all `.md` files repo-wide, which was too
    broad (an operational runbook can legitimately reference a role-grant
    procedure and needs guarding, not a blanket Markdown exemption).

    It is also deliberately not a directory allowlist: an even earlier round
    of this guard listed `alembic/`, `app/`, `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`,
    `deploy/`, `docker/`, `nginx/`, plus a non-recursive top-level scan, and
    that list still missed real tracked surfaces
    (`.github/actions/setup-ci-python/action.yml`,
    `config/freeradius/schema.sql`,
    `config/freeradius/sql/admin_schema.sql`) simply because no one had
    added them to it yet. A tracked-files scan has no such gap: a new
    top-level directory or CI asset is in scope the moment it is committed,
    with no allowlist edit required.

def test_the_dotmac_ro_scan_actually_detects_the_string(tmp_path) -> None:
    """Sensitivity proof: point the scanner at a planted match outside the repo.

    A guard that only ever runs over a clean tree proves nothing about
    itself. This writes `dotmac_ro` into a file under pytest's `tmp_path`
    (never inside the repo's own scanned directories) and asserts the same
    scanning function used above actually finds it there — once in the
    lowercase spelling, and once in a differently-cased spelling
    (`DOTMAC_RO`), because PostgreSQL folds an unquoted identifier to
    lowercase and a case-sensitive scan would miss the second planted file.

    It also plants a decoy, `dotmac_router_ssh_example`, which contains
    `dotmac_ro` as a plain substring but is not a reference to this role;
    the word-boundary-aware matcher must NOT flag it, proving the fix for
    the true-positive cases above did not trade away correctness on the
    known collision shapes (`dotmac_router_ssh`, `dotmac_roles_r1_...`).

    Further planted cases close specific mutation gaps a smaller test suite
    left open:

    - A reference embedded inside otherwise-arbitrary binary bytes proves
      there is no binary-file exemption (an earlier design would have
      silently exempted this via a NUL-byte binary heuristic).
    - UTF-16LE AND UTF-16BE references, each in BOTH lowercase and
      differently-cased spellings, prove the covered-encodings premise and
      case folding are real in both byte orders — not just documented, and
      not just proven for one order or one case.
    - A UTF-16BE reference followed by NOTHING (end of file immediately
      after the last code unit) proves BE coverage is real, not incidental:
      every OTHER planted BE fixture here happens to be followed by
      another code unit, and that unit's zero byte is exactly what an LE
      pattern shifted one byte to the right needs to find the SAME bytes
      by accident — so deleting BE coverage entirely, or replacing it with
      a second LE pattern, would still pass every other BE assertion.
      Only a fixture with no trailing code unit can tell real BE coverage
      apart from this accidental shifted-LE match.
    - A decoy in the ASCII pattern with the needle at the START of a
      longer identifier proves the FOLLOWING boundary; a second decoy with
      the needle at the END of a longer identifier proves the PRECEDING
      boundary — a smaller test that only ever planted "prefix" decoys
      would still pass if both negative lookbehinds were deleted entirely.
      The same two collision shapes, UTF-16-encoded (both byte orders),
      are planted too — but the UTF-16 patterns have NO boundary check at
      all (see `_utf16_pattern`'s docstring for why), so these are proven
      to be DETECTED, as the accepted over-report, not excluded.
    - A UTF-16LE reference preceded by a single odd-length ASCII byte
      (so the reference itself starts at an odd file offset, not aligned
      to an even code-unit boundary from byte zero) proves detection does
      not depend on any assumption about where in the file a UTF-16
      payload begins.
    - The exact double-sided alignment collision that defeated an earlier
      boundary-lookaround design for UTF-16 — a genuine occurrence at an
      odd offset with unrelated bytes on BOTH sides that a 2-byte-wide
      lookaround misreads as identifier-continuation characters in each
      byte order simultaneously — must be DETECTED. This is the concrete
      case that proved a UTF-16 boundary check cannot know its own
      alignment and is a source of silent misses, not a refinement.
    - References adjacent to non-ASCII prose punctuation — surrounded by
      UTF-8 curly quotes, preceded by a UTF-8 em-dash, preceded by a UTF-8
      non-breaking space — must all still be DETECTED. An earlier version
      of the ASCII/UTF-8 boundary treated every non-ASCII byte as an
      identifier continuation character to close a narrower false-positive
      gap (`dotmac_roé` being flagged even though it is, strictly, one
      legitimate distinct identifier), and that silently stopped detecting
      exactly this shape of real occurrence — prose right next to the
      needle in a Markdown document, which is what this guard's OWN
      retirement documents look like. This guard must over-report, never
      under-report; these cases prove the reverted mistake stays reverted.
    - A UTF-16LE reference with a byte-order mark (`\xff\xfe`) IMMEDIATELY
      before it, with no gap, must be DETECTED.

    The test above only proves `_files_containing` matches correctly over an
    arbitrary path list — it never exercises `_dotmac_ro_scan_targets` or
    real tracked-file selection at all. That left a real gap: nothing failed
    if `_DOTMAC_RO_SELF_REFERENCING_FILES` grew a fourth entry, because
    `_dotmac_ro_scan_targets` would then legitimately exclude that new entry
    too, and no test exercised the target-builder against a tracked-file
    listing to notice.

    This builds a real, throwaway git repository under `tmp_path`, tracks
    the three genuinely accepted self-referencing files plus several decoy
    files that must NEVER be excludable, commits them, and proves
    `_dotmac_ro_scan_targets` drops exactly the three and nothing else. If
    `_DOTMAC_RO_SELF_REFERENCING_FILES` ever gains a fourth entry equal to
    any decoy's path, this test fails; any other fourth entry is caught
    instead by the independent-literal equality assertion in
    `test_dotmac_ro_never_reenters_migrations_app_or_scripts`.

    The decoys deliberately sit under `app/`, `alembic/`, and `.github/` —
    directories that were part of an EARLIER, rejected directory-allowlist
    design (see the module-level history above) — plus one brand-new
    top-level directory that has never appeared in any historical
    allowlist. A single decoy under `scripts/` alone would not catch a
    regression that narrowed `_tracked_files_with_modes`'s
    `git ls-files --stage` invocation back down to exactly the directories

    let a raw `OSError` propagate or silently skip the path. `ENOTDIR` for
    an `O_DIRECTORY` open against a plain regular file is POSIX-guaranteed
    and platform-consistent, unlike the symlink-plus-`O_DIRECTORY` case
    above — but this still asserts `_SCAN_REFUSAL_MARKER`, not
    `"could not be opened"` (the generic branch's own specific wording),
    for uniformity with every other refusal test in this file: the
    property under test is "an AssertionError, not a raw OSError, and not
    a silent skip," which the shared marker proves without also claiming
    to identify which branch fired.
