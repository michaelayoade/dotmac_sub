"""Deactivating a device is one atomic lifecycle slice, not a flag write.

The defect these tests pin down: ``is_active = False`` used to be written by
several callers directly, and each got only half a deactivation.

  1. ``collect_devices`` filtered the flag, and the projection reconciler
     deletes any row the derivation stops returning — so deactivation ERASED
     the device from the staff ledger.
  2. The topology warmer only visits pollable devices and nothing ever decayed
     ``live_status``, so a device warmed to ``up`` that left the pollable set
     stayed ``up`` forever.
  3. ``classify_node`` reads mgmt ``up`` + zero online customers as
     ``service_fault`` ("NOT an area outage"), so that frozen ``up`` silently
     vetoed outage detection and the customer surface reported the cabinet
     healthy indefinitely.

Release gate under test: an inactive or stale device can never project ``up``.

IMPORTANT: none of the NetworkDevice fixtures here set ``source``. The old
drift filter keyed on the retired ``zabbix_reconcile`` provenance and looked
healthy under test only because every existing fixture stamped it. Fixtures
without a source are what prove the replacement is authority-neutral.
