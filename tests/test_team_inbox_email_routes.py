"""Mailbox routing: the table that decides which team owns an inbound address.

`TeamInboxEmailRoute` had a model and a consumer
(`build_email_team_routing_plan`) but no writer outside direct SQL, which is
why production ran six live mailboxes against zero rows. This covers the CRUD
that closes that gap.

See docs/designs/TEAM_INBOX_ADMIN_UI_PORT.md §3 and §5 slice 6.
