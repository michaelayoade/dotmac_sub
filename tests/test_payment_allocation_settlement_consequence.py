"""Payment allocation must reach the prepaid consequence owner.

`financial.payments` ends after confirmed cash, invoice allocation, and
unallocated-credit evidence are committed. The durable `payment.received` event
invokes `financial.prepaid_service_renewals`, which is the sole owner of prepaid
period funding, entitlements, and billing-anchor advancement.

Before this, `PaymentAllocations` emitted no event at all, so the standalone
credit-allocation path created entitlements but never advanced
`Subscription.next_billing_at` — and the account was suspended again for service
it had already paid for.
