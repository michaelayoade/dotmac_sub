"""Non-vacuous proof of the census's zero-child successful-receipt check.

`find_successful_receipts_missing_child_evidence`
(`scripts/billing/census_prepaid_funding_consequence_gaps.py`) is the
structural check added 2026-09 round 7 for the exact defect this whole
round targets: a `draft_invoice_settled`/`funded` receipt that committed
with ZERO `PrepaidFundingTriggerSubscriptionOutcome` child rows. This plants
both shapes directly against the model layer -- a genuine bug in the
write-site invariant (`_record_prepaid_funding_trigger_execution`) would now
raise before such a row could ever be committed, so this test is deliberately
independent of that write path: it proves the DETECTOR itself is sound
against a hand-planted row, the way a real historical/pre-fix row (or a
future regression that reaches the database some other way) would look.
