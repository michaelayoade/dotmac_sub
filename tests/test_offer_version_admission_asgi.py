"""End-to-end proof of offer-version admission's REAL ASGI request graph.

Round 13 finding 4 retired the source-grep/direct-dependency-call shape this
file's predecessor (``tests/test_offer_version_admission_route_permissions.py``,
deleted by this same change) used: calling ``_require_offer_version_admission``
or the router gate directly, or inspecting source text/router membership,
proved nothing about the REAL ASGI dependency graph a live request actually
traverses — and that shape has now failed to catch a real bug (round 13's
``credential_kind`` lockout) despite three rounds of making it more elaborate.

Every test here mounts the ACTUAL ``app.api.catalog`` routers (``router`` and
``admission_router``) onto a real ``FastAPI()`` app, in the SAME shape
``app/main.py``'s router table uses (``/api/v1`` prefix, bare-authentication
``"user"`` dependency mode), and drives them with ``fastapi.testclient
.TestClient`` issuing REAL HTTP requests. The only override is
``require_user_auth`` — FastAPI's own supported dependency-override
mechanism, substituting the deepest LEAF authentication dependency with a
fixture-controlled principal, exactly as ``tests/test_dispatch_api.py`` and
several other suites in this repo already do for HTTP-level tests. Every
OTHER dependency in the chain (``require_method_permission``,
``_require_offer_version_admission``, ``authorize_offer_version_admission``,
and the in-transaction re-check inside ``OfferVersions.update``) executes
for real, against the real test database, through the real ASGI stack.

Evidence-precision note (Michael's ruling on evidence claims): the
observation each test below actually makes is stated in its own docstring —
"the mounted app" (a real ``TestClient`` request was issued and its response
observed), "a resolved dependency list" (the live route's own
``dependant.dependencies`` was inspected on an app that was actually
constructed and included), or both. Neither is a source-level import or a
direct call to an inner function.

    NARROWED CLAIM (round 14 finding 6): the earlier version of this test
    had the unguarded clone resolve ``SystemAdmission`` — the documented,
    allowlist-confined "no real principal" escape hatch — as its principal.
    That 201 proved dependency removal PLUS an authorization BYPASS (a

    dependency removal in isolation; a docstring claiming it proved the

    two DIFFERENT, narrower things, each honestly scoped to what its own
    fixture does:

    1. Removing the dependency AND resolving via ``SystemAdmission``
       bypasses BOTH layers — this is exactly why ``SystemAdmission``
       construction is independently confined to an AST-checked allowlist
       elsewhere (``tests/architecture/test_offer_access_requirement_
       boundary.py``'s ``test_system_admission_construction_is_confined_
       to_the_declared_allowlist``); this route deliberately is not on
       that allowlist, which is the point.
    2. Removing ONLY the route dependency, while still resolving a REAL,
       typed, unprivileged ``StaffPrincipal`` (the shape an actual caller
       reaching an unguarded route would have), does NOT bypass
       authorization — ``admit_offer_version``'s own in-transaction
       ``verify_admission_authorization`` recheck still refuses. This is
       defense in depth actually holding, not a vulnerability; the test

    else in this suite covers. OBSERVED: the mounted app, via a single

    ``_require_offer_version_admission`` and ``OfferVersions.update``'s own
    in-transaction ``verify_admission_authorization`` recheck — executes
    for real against the real database.

    A synchronous, single-process test cannot literally run a second,
    concurrent transaction mid-request without a heavier multi-connection
    harness this suite does not have; the accepted way to test a
    TOCTOU/revocation race in one process is to inject the "concurrent"
    revocation AT the exact seam between the two decisions under test, then
    verify the LATER decision (the one actually being tested) observes the
    committed change.

    PLACEMENT, narrowed precisely (round 15 finding 6 correction — the
    round 14 version of this docstring overclaimed what the fixture
    actually establishes). The round-13 version of this test injected the
    revocation in ``_admission_principal``, which the ROUTE calls BEFORE
    ``OfferVersions.update`` is ever entered, so a recheck moved to the
    very TOP of ``update`` would have observed the revocation just as
    well as the real placement. Round 14 moved the injection to wrap
    ``catalog_billing_governance.assert_offer_version_update_safe`` (the
    read-only validation call immediately before
    ``verify_admission_authorization`` in the real function) — genuinely
    stronger, but still NOT a proof of "immediately before the write" or
    "inside the same transaction" in the strict sense:

    - It distinguishes a recheck placed BEFORE this validation seam (would
      miss the revocation, return 200) from one placed AFTER it (observes
      the revocation, returns 403) — it does NOT distinguish "immediately
      after the seam" from "after the seam, with other statements before
      the actual mutation": a recheck moved later still, but still after
      this exact injection point, would pass this test identically.
    - The revocation is committed on the SAME session/request the
      mutation itself uses (the accepted single-process TOCTOU-injection
      technique described above) — this test does not independently
      verify the check and the mutation share one transaction boundary;
      that currently follows from reading ``OfferVersions.update``'s own
      source (no intervening commit), not from anything this test
      observes on its own.

    What this test DOES prove, at that narrower scope: a grant revoked
    after ``update``'s read-only validation runs, but before its recheck,
    is observed by that recheck — it is not a stale, top-of-function check
    a later revocation could slip past.

    Break condition: this fails (a 200 where it must be 403) if
    ``OfferVersions.update`` stops calling ``verify_admission_authorization``
    AFTER its read-only validation, or if that call is ever moved earlier
