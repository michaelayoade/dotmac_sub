# `subscribers.metadata` — ownership census

Dated 2026-08-22, measured by
[`scripts/architecture/subscriber_metadata_census.py`](../scripts/architecture/subscriber_metadata_census.py)
against Sub `dev`. This is a **census**, not a design for a metadata service.
The outcome of the work it scopes is that this column stops holding facts, not
that it gains a nicer front door.

## Why this is not "add a metadata service"

The obvious move — one typed facade in front of the blob, every writer routed
through it — is the wrong one. It would leave every fact in an unowned JSONB
column, add a single place where any feature can still write any key, and make
the wildcard write below look like an ownership boundary. A facade over
unbounded JSON mutation is unbounded JSON mutation with a docstring.

Each retained fact gets a **named owner and a typed command**. Each obsolete
fact gets deleted. What remains readable from the column is a rebuildable
compatibility projection, and nothing decides anything from it.

## Measured position

| | |
|---|---|
| Direct writer modules | **8** |
| Read-only modules | **14** |
| Distinct keys | **33** |
| Keys written by more than one module | 1 (`subscriber_category`) |
| Keys any admin can invent at runtime | **unbounded** — see the wildcard below |

### The count was seven, and seven was wrong

`docs/ISP_COHORT1_SOURCE_OWNERSHIP.md` recorded seven writers. The key-level
census finds **eight**, and the difference is not a tightening of definitions:

- **`app/services/subscriber.py` was missing.** The column's own declared
  owner service writes four `restricted_*` keys into it.
- **`app/services/web_customer_actions.py` was missing.** It writes seven
  notification-preference keys and carries the wildcard.
- **`app/services/web_customer_details.py` was counted and does not write.**
  It only reads `nin_verified` and `nin_last_checked_at`.

A file-level census cannot see any of that. It answers "does this file mutate
the column", which is the right question for a retirement ratchet and the wrong
one for ownership. The ratchet in this document therefore starts at **8**.

## The wildcard, which blocks everything else

`app/web/admin/customers.py` parses an admin form field `metadata_json` as
arbitrary JSON and hands it to `web_customer_actions`, which writes it wholesale:

```python
if metadata_json is not None:
    metadata_payload = dict(metadata_json)
    metadata_payload["subscriber_category"] = before.category.value
    data["metadata_"] = metadata_payload
```

Any admin can create any key with any value on any subscriber. **No ownership
assignment below survives this.** Assigning `recovery_deleted_at` to an owner
means nothing while a form field can set `recovery_deleted_at` to a string of
someone's choosing, and a typed command that validates its input is decorative
next to an endpoint that validates none.

This is the one item that must close before the others are worth doing, and it
closes by **deletion of the capability**, not by validation of it. There is no
legitimate operator need to invent a key on a customer record; every key that
matters is enumerated below and belongs to a service.

## Classification

Five classes. The class determines the remedy, so it is recorded per key rather
than per module — three modules write keys of more than one class.

### Authoritative state — has an owner, needs a typed home

Facts nothing else records. Losing them loses the fact.

| Key | Written by | Owner to hold it | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recovery_deleted_at` | `web_system_restore_tool` | **`customer.account_recovery`** (new) | timestamp |
| `recovery_deleted_by` | `web_system_restore_tool` | `customer.account_recovery` | actor id |
| `recovery_purged_at` | `web_system_restore_tool` | `customer.account_recovery` | timestamp, terminal |
| `recovery_last_restored_at` | `web_system_restore_tool` | `customer.account_recovery` | timestamp |
| `recovery_last_restored_by` | `web_system_restore_tool` | `customer.account_recovery` | actor id |
| `account_deletion_requested_at` | `account_deletion` | `customer.account_recovery` | timestamp |
| `account_deletion_reason` | `account_deletion` | `customer.account_recovery` | free text |
| `portal_read_notification_keys` | `customer_portal_notifications` | **`customer.portal_notifications`** | unbounded list — see below |
| 7 × `*_notifications`, `sms_updates` | `web_customer_actions` | **`customer.notification_policy`** (exists) | booleans |

**Two deletion lineages, one lifecycle.** `account_deletion` writes
`account_deletion_*`; `web_system_restore_tool` writes `recovery_deleted_*`.
They record the same event — this account was deleted — in different key
families, written by different modules, with no relationship between them and
no rule about which wins. That is the strongest single argument for extracting
account recovery as its own state rather than tidying the keys in place.

**`portal_read_notification_keys` is an unbounded list inside a row.** Every
notification a customer reads appends an entry. It has no cap, no pruning and
no index, and it is rewritten in full on every read receipt. It is a join table
wearing a JSON array.

### Derived projection — rebuildable, must not be decided from

| Key | Written by | Derived from | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nin_verified` | `nin_verifications` | `subscriber_nin_verifications` ledger | compatibility projection; readers repoint to the ledger |
| `nin_last_checked_at` | `nin_verifications` | same ledger | same |
| `restricted_since`, `restricted_status`, `last_restricted_status`, `last_restricted_ended_at` | `subscriber.py` | service restriction state | move to `access.subscription_lifecycle` |

`web_customer_actions` already **decides** from one of these:

```python
if bool((before.metadata_ or {}).get("nin_verified")) and data["nin"] != before.nin:
    data["nin"] = before.nin
```

A projection is refusing an edit to the authoritative column. That is the exact
failure mode item 6 guards against, and it is present today: the projection must
become read-only-for-display before the ledger can be trusted as the owner.

### Observation — a record that something was attempted

| Key | Written by | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `geocode_attempted_at` | `customer_location_requests` | **`gis.spatial_sync`** — it is a geocode attempt, and that service owns coordinates as of PR #2620 |
| `crm_customer_name_remediation_digest` | `crm_customer_name_repair` | **`dotmac_kernel.idempotency`** — it is a replay marker, and at-most-once execution already has one owner (ADR-0014) |

### Integration payload — someone else's data, frozen

| Key | Read by | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `splynx_date_add`, `splynx_last_update` | `subscriber.py` | legacy Splynx import provenance |
| `splynx_deleted`, `splynx_status` | `customer_account_visibility` | same |
| `crm_person_id` | `cross_app_drift` | CRM provenance |

These stay as an opaque, frozen import record. Nothing writes them, they carry
no decisions the migration must reproduce, and they are read for provenance
only. They are the one class where remaining in a JSON blob is the correct
answer — but they belong in a clearly named provenance column, not mixed with
live state.

### Obsolete — delete, do not migrate

| Key | Why |
|---|---|
| `subscriber_category` | A JSON copy of `Subscriber.category`, a real typed column. Written by `web_customer_actions` (which stamps it from the column it duplicates) and read by **nine** modules. The duplicate exists so that readers can avoid a column read; the column is on the same row. |
| `latitude`, `longitude` | A **fourth** place an address coordinate lives, after `Address.latitude/longitude`, `Address.geom` and `GeoLocation`. Read by `web_customer_details` as a fallback when the column is null. `gis.spatial_sync` is the declared coordinate owner. |
| `send_billing_notifications` | Written beside `billing_notifications` by the same module. Two keys, one preference. |

`latitude`/`longitude` are reached through `getattr(customer, "metadata_", None)`,
which the census deliberately does not resolve — see its "Known limit" section.
They are recorded here because a census that omits what it cannot see is worse
than one that says so.

## The ratchet

[`tests/architecture/subscriber_metadata_writers_baseline.txt`](../tests/architecture/subscriber_metadata_writers_baseline.txt),
enforced by
[`test_subscriber_metadata_ownership.py`](../tests/architecture/test_subscriber_metadata_ownership.py).
Membership only, two-directional, starting at **8** and targeting zero.

Membership rather than magnitude is deliberate. A module either writes this
column or it does not; how many lines it takes says nothing about ownership, and
a site count would reward consolidating six writes into one loop over giving the
fact an owner.

The guard's load-bearing half is `test_every_receiver_is_classified`. A writer
behind a receiver the census cannot resolve escapes every other check, so an
unresolvable `<name>.metadata_` fails the build. Resolution is by binding —
annotation, construction, `db.get`, a query terminal, a loop over a query, or a
function's return annotation — **never by variable name**. Trusting names
reported twelve writers where there are eight, counting a `BrandProfile` blob
and an inbox conversation as subscriber facts, because half this codebase's
receivers are called `target`, `existing` or `record`.

## Order of work

1. **Close the wildcard.** Nothing else holds while it is open.
2. **Extract account recovery** — the highest-risk writer, both deletion
   lineages, `recovery_snapshot`, and the purge sweep. Lower the ratchet 8 → 7
   in the same change.
3. `portal_read_notification_keys` → a real table.
4. Notification preferences → `customer.notification_policy`, which exists.
5. `nin_*` → read from the ledger; the projection becomes display-only and the
   edit-refusal above moves to the ledger.
6. Delete `subscriber_category`, `latitude`, `longitude`,
   `send_billing_notifications`.
7. `restricted_*` → `access.subscription_lifecycle`.
8. `geocode_attempted_at` → `gis.spatial_sync`;
   `crm_customer_name_remediation_digest` → the kernel idempotency owner.
9. Splynx and CRM provenance → a named provenance column, frozen.

## `recovery_snapshot` is not metadata

Called out separately because it is not a key like the others.
`web_system_restore_tool._build_snapshot` serialises a subscriber's
subscriptions, service orders and CPE devices — ids, statuses, cancellation
timestamps — into a JSON value on the subscriber row, and
`_apply_soft_delete_cascade` then soft-deletes the real rows. The snapshot is
the **only** record of what the account looked like before deletion, and
restoring reads it back.

So it is recovery evidence carrying real referential meaning, held in a column
with no schema, no constraint, no foreign key and no size bound, on the same row
whose deletion it describes. It cannot be validated, cannot be queried, and
cannot be repaired if it is wrong. Extracting account recovery means giving this
a typed home with real references — which is why account recovery is the first
conversion and not a later one.
