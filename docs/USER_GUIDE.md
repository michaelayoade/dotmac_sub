---

## 2. Getting Started

### First Login

1. Navigate to your domain's `/auth/login` page
2. Enter your admin credentials (username + password)
3. You'll land on the **Admin Dashboard**

The sidebar navigation has three groups:
- **Core** — Dashboard, Customers, Billing, Catalog
- **Operations** — Network, Provisioning, GIS, VPN
- **Insights** — Reports, Notifications, System

### First 15 Minutes Checklist

1. Confirm company branding and email settings under **System**
2. Check the dashboard for open invoices, tickets, and recent system activity
3. Verify offers exist before creating live subscriptions
4. Confirm PPPoE / RADIUS defaults before activating internet services
5. Check that payment providers are configured before sending customers to the portal

### Before You Make a Live Change

> Treat billing, PPPoE, and provisioning changes as production operations. Confirm the subscriber, service, effective date, and rollback path before saving.

| Change Type | Verify First | Typical Risk |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Plan change | Billing mode, proration, effective date | Unexpected invoice or credit |
| Suspension / reactivation | Outstanding balance and communication history | Service restored or blocked incorrectly |
| PPPoE credential reset | Subscriber identity and active session status | Session collision or support call spike |
| ONT re-assignment | Correct serial number and target port | Wrong customer mapped to hardware |

---

## 3. Admin Dashboard

The dashboard displays key business metrics at a glance.

![Admin Dashboard](guide_screenshots/03_dashboard.png)

**KPI Cards:**
- Active Subscribers — total with active status
- Monthly Revenue — payments received this month
- Open Invoices — unpaid invoices
- Open Tickets — support tickets pending

**Recent Events Table** shows the latest system activity.

---

## 4. Customer Management

### Subscriber List

Navigate to **Customers** in the sidebar.

![Customers](guide_screenshots/05_customers.png)

- Search by name, email, phone, account number
- Filter by status (Active, Suspended, Blocked)
- Click any row for subscriber details

### Creating a Subscriber

1. Click **+ New Subscriber**
2. Fill in: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone
3. Select a **POP Site** (determines NAS assignment)
4. Click **Create**

The system generates a unique subscriber number and associates the customer with their POP site for provisioning.

### Recommended Customer Creation Order

1. Create the customer record with correct contact information
2. Confirm service address and POP site
3. Add the subscription only after selecting the correct offer
4. Review generated PPPoE credentials before sharing them
5. Trigger invoice or activation only after verifying billing mode

---

## 5. Catalog & Subscriptions

### Managing Offers

Navigate to **Catalog > Offers**.

![Catalog Offers](guide_screenshots/08_catalog_offers.png)

Each offer defines: name, service type, speed, pricing (recurring), billing mode (prepaid/postpaid), and FUP policy.

### Creating a Subscription

1. Go to customer detail → **+ Add Subscription**
2. Select an **Offer** from the catalog
3. Set billing mode and start date
4. Click **Create**

The system automatically generates PPPoE credentials, syncs to RADIUS, and emits a welcome notification.

### Subscription Sanity Checks

Use this quick review before saving a subscription:

| Item | What good looks like |
|------|----------------------|
| Offer | Correct speed, billing cycle, and tax mode |
| Billing mode | Matches how the customer is expected to pay |
| Start date | Aligned with install date or service handover |
| Portal visibility | Enabled only for plans you want customers to self-manage |
| RADIUS profile | Present when access control or speed policy is required |

### Fair Usage Policy (FUP)

![FUP Configuration](guide_screenshots/10_fup_rules.png)

Configure per-plan data limits with threshold rules, time windows, day filters, and rule chaining. Use the **Simulate & Test** tab to preview behavior.

---

## 6. Billing & Payments

### Billing Overview

![Billing](guide_screenshots/06_billing_overview.png)

Metrics: total billed, outstanding, overdue. Monthly revenue trend chart.

### Invoices

![Invoices](guide_screenshots/07_invoices.png)

**Lifecycle:** Draft → Issued → Overdue → Paid

Invoices are auto-generated on subscription activation, billing cycle completion, and plan changes (proration).

### Dunning & Auto-Suspension

1. Invoice becomes overdue → warning email sent
2. Grace period (configurable, default 48 hours)
3. After grace → subscriber suspended, RADIUS credentials removed
4. Payment received → auto-reactivation

### Daily Billing Checks

- Review draft and overdue invoices at the start of each workday
- Confirm payments are allocated before manually reactivating service
- Use notes or communication history before overriding an automatic suspension
- Validate proration outcomes after upgrades or downgrades on active subscriptions

---

## 7. Network Management

### OLTs

![OLTs](guide_screenshots/11_network_olts.png)

Manage fiber OLT infrastructure with SSH credentials, connected ONTs, and port utilization.

### ONTs

![ONTs](guide_screenshots/12_network_onts.png)

ONT lifecycle: Import from TR-069 → Assign to subscriber → Pre-flight check (9 points) → Provision.

### TR-069

![TR-069](guide_screenshots/15_network_tr069.png)

Manage CPE devices via GenieACS: sync, link, reboot, factory reset, parameter refresh.

### NAS Devices

![NAS](guide_screenshots/16_network_nas.png)

Configure RADIUS clients with shared secrets (encrypted via OpenBao).

### Quick Troubleshooting Flow

1. Confirm the subscriber has an active subscription
2. Check PPPoE username and password on the subscriber record
3. Verify the RADIUS client / NAS exists and is active
4. Review recent network or session errors
5. Confirm the assigned ONT or CPE is mapped to the correct subscriber

---

## 8. Provisioning

![Provisioning](guide_screenshots/17_provisioning.png)

Service order workflow: Created → Scheduled → Provisioning → Active.

The 13-step ONT provisioning orchestrator generates Huawei OLT CLI commands for T-CONT, GEM port, service profile, VLAN, WAN, and PPPoE configuration.

### Safe Provisioning Sequence

1. Validate subscriber, offer, and access technology
2. Confirm OLT, port, VLAN, and ONT serial assignment
3. Run pre-flight checks before pushing commands
4. Save generated commands or evidence for rollback
5. Verify service activation from both provisioning and subscriber views

---

## 9. Monitoring & Alerts

![Monitoring Dashboard](guide_screenshots/13_network_monitoring.png)

### Dashboard Components
- Device Status KPIs (online/offline/degraded)
- Device Health Table (CPU, memory, temperature, uptime)
- Bandwidth Overview with top consumers
- ONU Status Charts
- VPN Tunnel Status
- Active Alarms

### Alert Rules

Create threshold-based alerts with metric type, operator, threshold, duration, and severity. When alerts trigger, notifications are sent via the escalation chain: Policy → On-call → Admin fallback.

### What Needs Immediate Attention

| Signal | Why it matters | First response |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Many subscribers drop at once | Likely shared infrastructure issue | Check POP, NAS, OLT, and topology alarms |
| Single ONT offline after install | Provisioning or physical issue | Review provisioning job and optical levels |
| Repeated high CPU / memory on a device | Risk of service degradation | Inspect device metrics and recent config changes |
| Notification queue backlog | Customer comms are delayed | Check Celery worker health and SMTP/SMS settings |

---

## 10. Network Topology

![Network Topology](guide_screenshots/14_network_topology.png)

- **Nodes** = devices (color-coded by status)
- **Edges** = links (color-coded by utilization)
- Parallel links rendered as curved arcs
- Click nodes for drilldown panel
- Filter by POP site and topology group

### Creating Links

1. Click **Add Link**
2. Select source/target device and interface
3. Set role, medium, capacity
4. Optional: bundle key, topology group
