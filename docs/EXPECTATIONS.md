## Invoice Tax Inclusion

Invoices always calculate tax from line item tax rates. There is no invoice-level
toggle to include or exclude tax from the invoice total.

- Tax rates are selected per line item.
- Tax is computed from the line items and shown in the invoice summary.
- Invoice total always equals subtotal plus tax.
- Any change to line items recalculates subtotal, tax, total, and balance due.
