# Purchase Order ERP Cutover

Owner: `integration.procurement_purchase_order_cutover`

This runbook moves purchase-order origination from CRM to Selfcare and stages a
bounded set of approved historical quotes. It is a production financial control,
not a generic backfill utility.

## Preconditions

1. Name the Selfcare and ERP hosts and record UTC start time, deployed revisions,
   and immutable image digests.
2. Prove the ERP `/api/v1/sync/sub/purchase-orders` endpoint and the Selfcare
   `erp.outbox.deliver.v1` capability are enabled.
3. Prove the CRM purchase-order endpoint is retired or the CRM sender is disabled.
   Do not rely on a failing certificate as sender retirement evidence.
4. In read-only transactions, prove each target has one pinned approved quote,
   positive active lines, no `procurement_order_reference`, no PO outbox row, and
   no ERP `sub` correlation or `sub-wo:{installation_id}` PO.
5. Resolve every included vendor to exactly one active ERP supplier. Capture the
   existing Selfcare supplier-reference SHA-256, the exact endpoint-resolvable
   ERP `erpnext_id` or unique supplier code, match method, and ERP UTC
   verification time. A fuzzy or ambiguous match is a blocker. For code/name
   matches, pass the canonical ERP supplier code so the command can store it in
   both provider-reference and code fields. Do not log names, raw payloads,
   credentials, or connection strings.
6. Use at most 100 exact `installation:quote:vendor` targets. Exclude unresolved
   vendors; never guess or create a supplier as part of this command.

## Staging acceptance

Deploy the immutable candidate to the named staging Selfcare environment. Run
the operator adapter with staging-only records and a fresh command UUID:

```text
python -m scripts.procurement.cutover_purchase_orders --apply \
  --command-id <uuid> --actor <operator> --scope staging:purchase_order \
  --reason <reviewed-reason> \
  --target <installation>:<quote>:<vendor> \
  --verification '<vendor>|<current-sha256>|<erp-reference>|<verified-at>|<method>'
```

Confirm the command returns `owner=sub`, one outbox ID per target, and an audit
row with action `procurement.purchase_order_cutover`. Let the normal outbox worker
deliver. Confirm ERP acceptance, a PO identifier in the redacted response, and
`installation_projects.procurement_order_reference` write-back. Re-running the
same command UUID must return `replayed=true` without another outbox row or PO.

## Production execution

Deploy only the candidate digest accepted in staging and authorized from `main`.
Repeat all read-only preconditions immediately before execution because supplier,
quote, and ownership evidence can drift. Run one command containing only the
verified production target subset. The command must begin with owner `crm`; it
commits vendor binding changes, owner `sub`, outbox rows, and audit evidence in
one transaction or rolls everything back.

Monitor `field_erp_sync_events` by returned event ID until every row is terminal.
For each row record status, attempts, timestamps, redacted error/response, ERP PO
ID, and the matching installation write-back. Treat `pending`, `dead`, `rejected`,
missing response IDs, or missing write-backs as unresolved incidents.

## Failure and recovery

- Validation failure: no cutover occurred. Correct the source evidence, obtain a
  new ERP verification, and use a new command UUID if the intended inputs change.
- Transport failure after commit: do not flip ownership back or insert rows.
  Keep the stable outbox record and use its normal retry/dead-letter procedure.
- ERP accepted but write-back is absent: run the existing PO response repair; do
  not resend or manually populate the project reference.
- Unresolved supplier: leave its projects out of the batch. Finance must create
  or identify the canonical ERP supplier through the ERP-owned supplier process,
  after which a separately reviewed follow-up reconciliation command is required.
