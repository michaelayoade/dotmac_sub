# DotMac Sub — UI/UX Master Plan

## Architecture Principles

### Centralized Service Layer

Every feature follows a **three-tier pattern** where business logic lives once:

```
Core Service (app/services/{module}.py)
   ├── API Route (app/api/{module}.py)        → JSON responses
   └── Web Service (app/services/web_{module}.py) → template context
        └── Web Route (app/web/admin/{module}.py) → thin wrapper
```

**Rules:**
- Core services own ALL queries, mutations, validation, and stats computation
- Web services only transform core service output into template context dicts
- Routes (API and web) are thin wrappers — no `db.query()`, no conditionals, no aggregation
- Every dashboard stat method lives in the core service as `get_dashboard_stats(db) -> dict`
- API and web routes call the same `get_dashboard_stats()` — identical numbers everywhere

### Dashboard Stats Service Pattern

Every module that has a dashboard exposes a stats method in its core service:

```python
# app/services/{module}.py
class ModuleManager(ListResponseMixin):
    @staticmethod
    def get_dashboard_stats(db: Session, *, organization_id: str | None = None) -> dict:
        """Return all KPIs for this module's dashboard."""
        ...
        return {
            "kpi_cards": [...],
            "charts": {...},
            "tables": {...},
            "alerts": [...],
        }
```

This method is called by:
- `GET /api/v1/{module}/dashboard` → returns JSON
- `GET /admin/{module}` → web service wraps into template context

## Module-by-Module Specification

---

## 1. MAIN DASHBOARD (`/admin/dashboard`)

**Accent color:** slate (system)
**Purpose:** Single-screen operational health. Answer "is anything broken?" in 2 seconds.

### KPI Cards (top row, 4 cards)

| Card | Value | Trend | Link |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Active Subscribers | count | % change vs last month | `/admin/subscribers?status=active` |
| MRR | currency | % change vs last month | `/admin/reports/revenue` |
| Open Service Orders | count | new today | `/admin/provisioning?status=pending` |
| Network Health | percentage | devices online / total | `/admin/network/monitoring` |

### Attention Required Panel (right sidebar, always visible)

Red/amber items that need operator action:
- Overdue invoices count + total amount → link to filtered invoice list
- Failed service orders count → link to filtered order list
- Offline devices count → link to monitoring with offline filter
- Expiring subscriptions (next 7 days) → link to filtered subscription list
- Failed webhook deliveries (last 24h) → link to webhook history
- Celery task failures (last 24h) → link to scheduler

### Charts Row (2 charts side-by-side)

**Left: Revenue Trend** (area chart, 30d default)
- Billed vs collected overlay
- Time range selector: 7d / 30d / 90d / YTD

**Right: Subscriber Growth** (line chart, 30d default)
- Net growth (new minus churned)
- Stacked: new signups (emerald) + cancellations (rose)

### Activity Feed (bottom left, 60% width)

Recent system events: payments received, subscribers created, orders completed, devices online/offline.
Each row: icon + description + relative timestamp + link to entity.

### Quick Actions (bottom right, 40% width)

Large icon buttons for frequent tasks:
- New Subscriber
- Record Payment
- Create Invoice
- Create Service Order

### Service: `app/services/dashboard.py`

```python
class DashboardStats:
    @staticmethod
    def get_stats(db: Session) -> dict:
        return {
            "subscribers": {"active": N, "trend": +X%},
            "mrr": {"value": Decimal, "trend": +X%},
            "open_orders": {"count": N, "new_today": N},
            "network_health": {"percentage": 98.5, "online": N, "total": N},

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 mb-6">
    {% for card in stats.kpi_cards %}
    {% include "components/data/stats_card.html" %}
    {% endfor %}
</div>

<!-- Charts Row -->
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6">
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700 p-6">
        {% include "components/charts/area_chart.html" %}
    </div>
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700 p-6">
        {% include "components/charts/doughnut_chart.html" %}
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Attention / Tables Row -->

</div>
{% endblock %}

### API Routes (thin wrappers → core services)

```
app/api/
├── billing.py                → billing_service.*
├── subscribers.py            → subscriber_service.*
├── catalog.py                → catalog_service.*  (NEW — if missing)
├── provisioning.py           → provisioning_service.*
├── network.py                → network_service.*  (NEW — if missing)
├── radius.py                 → radius_service.*   (NEW — if missing)
├── notifications.py          → notification_service.*
├── integrations.py           → integration_service.*
├── usage.py                  → usage_service.*    (NEW — if missing)
├── reports.py                → reporting_service.* (NEW — if missing)
├── settings.py               → domain_settings.*

└── system.py                 → system_service.*   (NEW — if missing)
```

### Key Principle

Every `get_dashboard_stats()` method in a core service is callable from both:
- `GET /api/v1/{module}/dashboard` → returns JSON
- `GET /admin/{module}` → web service wraps into template context

This guarantees API consumers and admin UI users always see the same numbers.
