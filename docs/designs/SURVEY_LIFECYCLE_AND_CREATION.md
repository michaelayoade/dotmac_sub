# Survey lifecycle and creation source of truth

Status: implemented

## Owner and page contract

`communications.surveys` (`app.services.surveys`) owns Survey content,
lifecycle, invitation identity, response validation, metrics, idempotency, and
public-answer eligibility. Admin, API, public, and event-handler modules are
adapters. They create and close sessions, build typed commands, map domain
errors, and never write Survey records or complete business transactions.

The admin creation screen is `/admin/surveys/new`. Its audience is an
authenticated general administrator and its job is to save a reusable Survey
definition as a draft. The first viewport shows the breadcrumb, the `Create
Survey` heading, editable basic information, and the start of the ordered
question builder. `POST /admin/surveys` is the only primary action; Cancel is a
secondary navigation action. Both cards are part of one CSRF-protected form.
Validation errors render the same HTML projection with status 400 and preserve
the safely parsed form state. Success redirects with HTTP 303 to the canonical
Survey detail page.

The list screen `/admin/surveys` supports scanning identity, question count,
and lifecycle state. `New Survey` is its single page-level primary action.
Mobile keeps identity, state, and actions reachable without horizontal page
scrolling; the table itself uses a bounded horizontal work surface when needed.

## Typed content

Editable Survey fields are `name`, `description`, `trigger_type`,
`public_slug`, `thank_you_message`, and the ordered JSON question array.
Question objects use the closed `rating`, `nps`, `multiple_choice`, and
`free_text` vocabulary. Keys use one case-sensitive identifier policy and must
be unique. Multiple-choice options are ordered, trimmed, nonblank,
case-insensitively unique, and bounded to 2-50 values of at most 200 characters.

The browser serializes its complete ordered state into `questions_json`.
`SurveyCreate`/`SurveyUpdate` and `SurveyQuestion` reparse and validate the
complete untrusted payload. Invalid objects are never dropped. A draft may
contain no questions, but activation and distribution fail closed until at
least one valid question exists.

Public slugs normalize spaces and underscore-separated words into lowercase
hyphenated form. Existing hyphen mistakes remain visible validation failures;
the owner does not silently repair repeated, leading, or trailing separators.
The database unique constraint arbitrates concurrent slug creation and the
adapter receives a stable friendly domain error.

## Lifecycle and public access

The lifecycle is `draft -> active -> paused or closed`; a paused Survey may be
reactivated and a closed Survey may not. Creation always sets `draft` and
`is_active=true`. `is_active` is a row-level administrative availability fact,
not lifecycle state.

Every public and tracked response lookup requires all of:

- `status=active`;
- `is_active=true`;
- no expired `expires_at`; and
- at least one valid question.

A public slug never bypasses those checks. Unavailable and unknown references
share the same safe public response. Response labels, options, names,
descriptions, and thank-you messages render through Jinja autoescaping; no
user-supplied Survey value uses `safe`.

## Creator, transactions, and idempotency

Creation resolves the authenticated `SystemUser` inside the owner transaction
and requires its reviewed `person_party_id`. Browser-supplied creator,
lifecycle, expiry, segment, and metric values are absent from the command and
cannot be mass-assigned.

Every mutation enters `execute_owner_command` once. Creation keys are generated
on the server-rendered form and bind durably to a canonical content
fingerprint. A repeated identical POST returns the original Survey; reuse with
different content fails. Public slug, creation key, invitation source, and
tracked-response database constraints arbitrate concurrency.

Creation stages one Survey row, one audit record, and one identifier-only
domain event. It creates no invitation, response, notification, Ticket,
Work Order, or Project.

## Invitations and event triggers

Manual Send may activate a valid draft or paused Survey inside the same Survey
owner command. Automatic invitations consume the existing authoritative
events:

- `ticket.resolution_confirmed` for `ticket_closed`; and
- `work_order.field_outcome_recorded` with exact outcome `complete` for
  `work_order_completed`.

`SurveyTriggerHandler` is a delivery adapter. It does not infer status or poll
Tickets and Work Orders. The Survey owner queries only active, active-row,
unexpired Surveys with the matching trigger, validates that questions remain
distributable, and creates at most one invitation for a Survey, recipient, and
source event. Notification delivery is requested through the existing
communication-intent owner with a dedupe key; transport and retry remain in the
durable notification pipeline.

Tracked responses lock and complete their invitation and can be recorded only
once. Response validation is authoritative in the Survey owner. Answer payloads
are never written to audit or event metadata. Aggregate counts and rating/NPS
projections are recomputed from persisted responses in the response
transaction.

## Migration and repair

Migration `458_survey_lifecycle_and_creation` is additive. It preserves legacy
rows as drafts, adds lifecycle/content/provenance/metric columns, creates the
invitation ledger, and links tracked responses. A nullable creator on legacy
rows is migration evidence; every new create requires a resolved Person.

The old `app.services.comms` Survey and SurveyResponse writers are removed.
`rebuild_survey_projections` idempotently recomputes invitation/response totals,
average rating, and NPS from canonical invitation and response rows. Invitation
repair replays durable ticket/work-order events. Repair never sets a Survey
active from `is_active`, reconstructs a trigger from timestamps, or re-enables
the retired writer.
