# Support Ticket lifecycle source of truth

Status: implemented

## Canonical owner

`support.ticket_lifecycle` (`app.services.support`) is the only lifecycle
writer. The retired `support.tickets` architecture name has no registry entry
and must not appear as an owner, dependency, or client contract.

The lifecycle owner controls, in one root owner command:

- Ticket creation, native identity, customer/Lead binding, and ticket number;
- guarded status transitions and their resolved/closed timestamps;
- team, technician, manager, coordinator, and additional-assignee state;
- comments, explicit mentions, attachment metadata, and the official timeline;
- links, duplicate evidence, merges, and merged-source immutability;
- resolution requests, active confirmation capabilities, confirmation, disputes,
  and automatic confirmation after the configured grace period;
- CSAT/satisfaction evidence; and
- transactionally staged audit records, domain events, notifications, and SLA
  consequences.

Adapters may create/close sessions and map `DomainError` values. They do not
commit lifecycle changes. Every public mutation enters
`execute_owner_command` once on a transaction-free session; nested helpers use
`flush()` only.

## Configuration and policies

`support.ticket_configuration` owns operator-managed status choices,
priorities, types, routing inputs, service-team membership configuration, and
priority/type SLA targets. It may only expose statuses from the lifecycle
vocabulary.

Assignment is split deliberately:

- `support.ticket_assignment_rule_configuration` owns typed assignment rules;
- `support.ticket_assignment_evaluation` evaluates active rules and owns only
  its locked round-robin cursor; it returns an immutable `AssignmentResult`;
- the Ticket owner rechecks and applies the proposed team/person consequence.

Automation has the same separation:

- `support.ticket_automation_rule_configuration` owns typed automation rules;
- `support.ticket_automation_evaluation` returns immutable
  `TicketAutomationProposal` values and never writes a Ticket or rule firing
  timestamp;
- the Ticket owner validates and applies accepted consequences.

Manual-review identity evidence fails closed for sensitive assignment and
automation. A policy never becomes a lifecycle writer merely because its
proposal is accepted.

## Related owners

`support.ticket_sla_clock` remains the Ticket SLA clock and breach owner.
`support.ticket_work_order_handoff` remains the only issuance/provenance
boundary into field work. Issuance requires ticket-update and dispatch-write
permission evidence plus an idempotency key. A field result may add internal
timeline evidence, but cannot resolve or close the Ticket.

Support and `communications.team_inbox` remain separate owners. No checked-in
workspace contract approves unification. Existing screens may compose their
read projections, but neither domain may mutate the other or introduce a
competing workspace lifecycle.

External CRM and communications products are observations, transports, or
provenance. Imported identifiers do not own Ticket status, assignment,
comments, resolution, or native Work-Order issuance.

## List and bulk UI contracts

`ui.support_ticket_list_projection` declares searchable fields, filters,
stable sorting, pagination, summaries, and export scope through one typed
`ListQuery`. `ui.support_ticket_bulk_action_projection` declares page-only
selection and action presentation. `support.ticket_bulk_commands` resolves
membership, normalizes the shared changes, previews eligibility, binds the
preview to a deterministic scope token, and detects drift. Confirmed mutations
delegate to `support.ticket_lifecycle`; there is no second bulk writer.

## Cutover and repair

The migration is complete only while architecture guards prove that:

- no Support service raises FastAPI `HTTPException` or completes a nested/root
  transaction directly;
- assignment and automation evaluators do not write Ticket lifecycle fields;
- every registered Support/UI service has a complete typed `ServiceContract`;
- the six completed services are absent from the shrink-only legacy manifest;
- the retired lifecycle-owner name is absent from architecture documents;
- Work-Order provenance is preserved and verified as described in
  `docs/runbooks/TICKET_WORK_ORDER_PROVENANCE_CUTOVER.md`; and
- Support/Inbox remain separate unless a later approved workspace contract is
  checked in.

Repair reruns deterministic list/preview queries, SLA reconciliation, or the
provenance verifier from canonical records. It never re-enables a legacy writer
or infers lifecycle authority from CRM, tags, templates, cached UI state, or
communication delivery.
