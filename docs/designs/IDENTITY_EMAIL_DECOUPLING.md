# Identity / Email Decoupling

**Status:** Design — not started
**Date:** 2026-06-20
**Scope (this doc):** Core only — Layers 1+2 (relax global email uniqueness; stop using email as a login key). Reseller-identity-off-subscribers (Layer 3) and `+NNNN` data cleanup are noted as follow-ups, not implemented here.

---

## 1. Problem & corrected diagnosis

The system overloads **email** and the **subscriber record** to serve three unrelated business concepts:

1. **Customer contact information** — "how do I reach this customer?"
2. **Login identity** — "who is signing into the portal?"
3. *(claimed)* **Ownership** — "which reseller owns this customer?"

The presenting symptom: many customers under one reseller legitimately share a contact email
(`owner@abcnetworks.com`, `wanserverng@gmail.com`), but the system rejects the duplicate, so emails
get mangled into `wanserverng+8265@gmail.com` to satisfy uniqueness.

### What the code actually shows (corrections to the original framing)

- **✅ Ownership is already correct and is NOT derived from email.** A customer belongs to a reseller
  via `Subscriber.reseller_id` → `Reseller.id` (`app/models/subscriber.py:245`); the reseller customer
  list filters `Subscriber.reseller_id == <uuid>` (`app/services/reseller_portal.py:121`). No code
  infers ownership from an email address or a `+suffix`. **Layer 3 of the original concern is a
  non-issue.**

- **✅ A real `Reseller` org entity and a `reseller_users` link table already exist**
  (`app/models/subscriber.py:118`, `:615`).

- **⚠️ A reseller's *login identity* is still a `Subscriber` row.** `reseller_users.person_id` is a FK
  to `subscribers.id`, and the reseller credential (`UserCredential.subscriber_id`) points at that same
  subscriber. So a reseller login occupies a slot in the global email-unique space. (Addressed by
  Layer 3 — out of scope here.)

- **❗ The real blocker is one constraint:** `email: ... unique=True` on `subscribers`
  (`app/models/subscriber.py:204`), backstopped by validation that hard-rejects duplicates
  (`app/services/validation_api.py:69`; `app/services/web_customer_actions.py:1042,1142,1358`).

- **❗ The `+NNNN` workaround is NOT in the codebase.** No creation/import/CRM path generates suffixed
  emails — the app only *rejects* duplicates. The mangled addresses in prod are **data** (legacy BSS import
  or manual). There is no code to delete; un-mangling is a separate data cleanup (follow-up).

- **❗ Hidden coupling:** login resolution treats `Subscriber.email` as a login key
  (`app/services/auth_flow.py:604` and a second resolver at `app/services/web_reseller_auth.py:35`).
  Uniqueness cannot simply be dropped without first removing email-as-login, or shared emails make
  email login ambiguous.

## 2. Target model

Separate the three concepts cleanly:

| Concept | Stored as | Uniqueness |
|---|---|---|
| Customer contact info | `Subscriber.email` (+ `phone`) | **None** — plain, indexed, nullable contact field |
| Login identity | `UserCredential.username` (local) / RADIUS / `SystemUser.email` (admins) | `username` unique per provider=local (already enforced, `app/models/auth.py:51`) |
| Ownership | `Subscriber.reseller_id` | already correct — no change |

Net effect: a reseller may onboard 500 customers all using `owner@abcnetworks.com` as contact email.
Each is a distinct `Subscriber` (distinct `id`, distinct `subscriber_number`, distinct login
credential where one exists). Email becomes descriptive, not identifying.

---

## 3. Scope

**In scope (this PR):**
- **Layer 1** — Drop the global `UNIQUE(email)` on `subscribers`; relax duplicate-email rejection.
- **Layer 2** — Stop resolving logins by `Subscriber.email`; make `username` the sole customer/reseller
  login key. Audit and harden every remaining "find subscriber by email" call site.

**Out of scope (follow-ups, tracked but not built here):**
- **Layer 3** — Move reseller portal users off `Subscriber` rows onto their own principal (add a
  `reseller_user` principal to `UserCredential`, or model like `SystemUser`).
- **Data cleanup** — dry-run-first one-off to un-mangle existing `+NNNN` emails to real addresses and
  de-dupe.

---

## 4. Changes by layer

### Layer 1 — Email becomes non-unique contact info

1. **Model** `app/models/subscriber.py:204`
   `email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)`
   → drop `unique=True`; keep a **non-unique index** for lookup performance. (Keep `nullable=False`
   for now to avoid touching every writer; nullability can relax later.)

2. **Migration** (new revision off current alembic head — see §6)
   - Drop the unique constraint/index backing `subscribers.email` (name varies by environment; the
     migration must introspect and drop whichever of `subscribers_email_key` / unique index exists,
     guarded for both Postgres and SQLite test DB).
   - Create a plain `ix_subscribers_email` index.

3. **Validation** `app/services/validation_api.py:69` `validate_email_unique`
   - Email is no longer an identity → this check should no longer **block**. Make it return
     `(True, None)` (or remove it and its two callers at `:122`, `:165`). Decide whether to keep a
     soft, non-blocking "this email is already used by N other customers" hint for the admin UI.

4. **Creation flows** `app/services/web_customer_actions.py:1042, 1142, 1358`
   - Remove the `raise ValueError("A customer with email ... already exists")` guards. Duplicate
     contact emails are valid.

5. **Error mapping** `app/services/web_system_common.py:54-59`
   - The `people/email already exists` → "Email already exists" mapping becomes dead for the email
     path; keep the **username** mappings (`:52-53,57`) since username uniqueness still applies.

### Layer 2 — Email is no longer a login key

`username`-based login already works: `_resolve_login_credential` matches `UserCredential.username`
first (`app/services/auth_flow.py:603`) and there is a partial unique index on `username` where
`provider='local'` (`app/models/auth.py:51`). The change is mostly *removing* the email fallback.

1. **`app/services/auth_flow.py:602-606`** — remove the `func.lower(Subscriber.email) == ...` OR clause
   from `_resolve_login_credential`. **Keep** the `SystemUser.email` clause (admin logins by email are
   legitimate and `system_users.email` stays unique).

2. **`app/services/web_reseller_auth.py:35`** — second resolver with a `Subscriber.email` OR; remove
   the email clause there too. Resellers log in by `username`.

3. **Prerequisite data backfill (BLOCKER before removing the email fallback):** every active local
   `UserCredential` that currently has a NULL/empty `username` and relies on email-login must get a
   `username` backfilled, or those users lose the ability to log in. Audit first:
   `SELECT count(*) FROM user_credentials WHERE provider='local' AND is_active AND (username IS NULL OR username='')`.
   Backfill from the linked subscriber's (real) email or `subscriber_number`. **Do this and verify in
   prod before merging the resolver change.**

### Layer 2 risk surface — "find subscriber by email" audit

Once email is non-unique, every lookup-by-email can return multiple rows. Each site below must be
triaged: re-key on a stable id, restrict to credentialed accounts, or explicitly accept "first/most
recent" with a logged caveat.

| Site | Today | Required handling |
|---|---|---|
| `app/api/crm_webhooks.py` `_find_existing_customer` | CRM upsert matches by `crm_person_id` then falls back to email `.first()` | **DEFERRED — blocked:** the whole `receive_crm_customer` / `_find_existing_customer` feature is uncommitted parallel-session WIP (not in `main`/HEAD), so this fix cannot ship in this PR without absorbing that work. Required follow-up on the customer-webhook branch: make the email fallback adopt only a *single* legacy record with no CRM link (else shared emails merge distinct customers — would regress the prior 4,499-dup CRM merge). Patch + tests are drafted and ready to graft on. |
| `app/services/auth_flow.py:1415` | lookup by email (password reset / account) | Restrict to accounts that have a login credential; if still ambiguous, refuse rather than guess. |
| `app/services/auth_flow.py:1695` | email-change uniqueness check | Remove/relax — email change no longer needs to be globally unique. |
| `app/services/customer_identity_resolution.py:578` | resolve identity by email | Must tolerate multiple matches; prefer id/`subscriber_number`/credential. |
| `app/services/web_customer_actions.py:1038` | existing-customer lookup in wizard | Becomes advisory ("possible existing match"), not a hard block. |
| `app/services/web_admin_resellers.py:59` | admin reseller-customer lookup by email | Tolerate multiple; surface a chooser or scope by `reseller_id`. |
| `app/services/subscriber.py:729` | bulk lookup `email IN (...)` | Audit consumers for "expects 1 row" assumptions. |
| `app/services/network_subscriber_bridge.py:129,154,167` | inventory match by email | Confirm inventory emails are still distinct enough, or re-key. |

Deliverable for this PR: each row resolved (re-keyed or proven safe), with a one-off SQL audit showing
no two *credentialed* customers shared an email pre-change (logins are unaffected; only contact emails
collapse).

## 5. Why this is safe for customer logins

Customer portal auth is primarily **RADIUS / PPPoE** keyed by `subscriber_id`, with an optional local
`UserCredential` keyed to the subscriber (see auth-portals design). Customers rarely authenticate by
typing an email. After Layer 2, anyone who *did* log in by email logs in by their backfilled
`username` instead. Admin (`SystemUser`) email login is untouched.

---

## 6. Migration plan

- Branch off **current `alembic` head**, not this tree's local `159` — prod has advanced (mig 160/161
  merged elsewhere). Run `alembic current` **inside the app container** before authoring the revision
  (standing prod-drift / stamp-wedge gotcha).
- One revision: drop unique on `subscribers.email`, add non-unique `ix_subscribers_email`. Guard for
  both Postgres (prod) and SQLite (test) — introspect the existing constraint/index name rather than
  hard-coding it.
- Idempotent / re-runnable; pg-guarded `IF EXISTS`.

---

## 7. Risks & rollback

- **Ambiguous lookups** (the §4 table) — the main risk. Mitigated by the audit + re-keying.
- **CRM merge hazard** (`crm_webhooks.py`) — highest blast radius; must re-key on `crm_subscriber_id`
  before relaxing uniqueness, or shared-email customers get merged. Echoes the prior 4,499-duplicate
  CRM merge — do not regress it.
- **Login lockout** if usernames aren't backfilled before the resolver change — see §4 prerequisite.
- **Rollback:** the resolver/validation changes are pure code (revert PR). The migration's reverse adds
  the unique constraint back — which will **fail if duplicate emails now exist**, so document that the
  downgrade is best-effort and effectively one-way once shared emails are created.

---

## 8. Test plan

- Two subscribers with identical `email`, distinct `username` → both creatable; both log in by their
  own username; neither logs in by the shared email.
- Admin `SystemUser` still logs in by email.
- CRM webhook with a shared email upserts the correct subscriber by `crm_subscriber_id` (no merge).
- Password reset for a shared email behaves deterministically (per §4 decision).
- Migration up/down on SQLite (test) and a Postgres check.

---

## 9. Open questions / follow-ups

1. **Layer 3** — give reseller portal users their own principal so a reseller login no longer needs a
   `Subscriber` row. Larger schema/auth change; separate design.
2. **Data cleanup** — dry-run-first one-off to un-mangle `+NNNN` → real email and de-dupe (follow the
   team's reconcile-CLI pattern: dry-run, `--execute`, run inside container).
3. **Password-reset-by-email policy** under shared emails — confirm desired behavior (refuse vs. send
   to all matching credentialed accounts).
4. Soft "email already used by N customers" hint in admin UI — keep or drop?
