# Inbox Customer Identification and Completion Gate

## Decision and scope

`communications.team_inbox_customer_completion_policy` owns immutable,
administrator-selected Customer completion-policy versions. Every new Inbox
conversation snapshots the latest version. A later settings change creates a
new row and affects only conversations created afterward. Migration 594 assigns
the initial version to existing active, unresolved conversations.

The initial policy requires `name`, `phone`, and `address`. The supported field
vocabulary also includes email, WhatsApp, organization, city/region, country,
DOB, gender, and NIN. The policy stores field keys rather than browser logic.

`communications.team_inbox_customer_completion` owns the resolution
`ActionReadiness` verdict and coordinates profile completion from Inbox into the
canonical Customer account and Party owners. Inbox metadata is observation or
compatibility context; it never satisfies the completion gate.

`customer.canonical_profile_patch` is the typed, flush-only Customer participant
used by that coordinator. It locks and updates the existing Subscriber and
primary service Address, stages `subscriber.updated`, and cannot create a
Customer. `party.registry` remains the owner for Party profile and contact-point
updates. The Inbox coordinator owns the surrounding atomic command, conflict
checks, audit evidence, and readiness refresh.

## Classification

- A conversation with an explicit Subscriber relationship is a Customer.
- A conversation with an active reviewed or completed intake Lead relationship
  is a Lead.
- Conflicting identity evidence is ambiguous; no identity is unresolved.
- A reviewed contact link always outranks newly observed display data.
- Without a reviewed link, an observed name may narrow an exact normalized
  phone match only by exact normalized Customer-name equality. A mismatch is
  ambiguous and requires the agent to choose an existing Customer or a Lead.

Customer selection searches and links an existing Customer only. Inbox has no
Customer-creation command. Lead actions may link an existing Lead or create a
Party-backed Lead through the existing Sales owner.

## Resolution rule

For agent-originated direct, bulk, and macro transitions to `resolved`, the
status owner asks the completion owner for one authoritative verdict:

- Customer: every field in the conversation's snapshotted version must be
  complete on the canonical Customer/Party profile.
- Lead: profile completeness is advisory and never blocks resolution.
- Unresolved or ambiguous: identification must be completed before resolution.

Bulk resolution skips blocked conversations and returns blocker details. Macro
resolution records the failed action and cannot bypass the same gate. System
maintenance and AI lifecycle reasons retain their separately owned transition
rules.

## Canonical save and conflicts

The Inbox Customer completion command locks the conversation and linked
Customer, confirms the exact link, validates only explicitly submitted typed
fields, and writes Subscriber and Party/contact-point facts inside one owner
transaction. It rebuilds the Customer identity index before returning the
fresh readiness verdict. The drawer is then reloaded from canonical data.

When an existing non-empty value differs from a proposed value, the command
returns both values and requires explicit field-level replacement confirmation.
Phone and email changes run through normalization and existing identity
collision checks. No parallel conversation profile is written.

Each changed field stages audit evidence containing decision source, actor ID,
actor type, timestamp, conversation ID, Customer ID, Party ID when present,
previous value, new value, and correlation ID. Identity-selection owners retain
their existing selected Customer/Lead/Party provenance.

## Projection freshness and repair

The readiness verdict is transaction-current and is always recomputed from the
snapshotted policy plus canonical records. The UI does not persist a readiness
flag. A missing policy snapshot, missing linked Customer, unsupported historic
field key, or ambiguous identity fails closed and is its own drift signal.
Reopening the drawer or retrying the status command deterministically rebuilds
the verdict; structural Lead-link repair remains with
`communications.conversation_lead_relationships`.
