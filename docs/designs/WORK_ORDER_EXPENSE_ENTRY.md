# Work-Order Expense Entry

## Decision

Authenticated staff who can open an exact admin work-order detail page may
create an expense claim from that page after a technician has been assigned.
Technician assignment is an expense-eligibility requirement, not an identity or
access rule: global dispatch-read access, or a matching reseller or region
scoped grant, permits both viewing the page and creating a claim. Field/mobile
expense entry retains its assigned-technician scope.

Every claim is bound to an active authoritative work order by the expense owner.
The admin browser supplies no work-order identifier: the route is authoritative.
Field/mobile/API callers supply only the typed public ID, which the owner
resolves under assignment/access rules. Internal database UUIDs, placeholders,
generic drafts, and standalone expense creation are not accepted.

The Field app never asks a technician to type that public ID. Entry from an
exact job carries the job identity into a locked field; entry from the Expenses
tab uses a searchable choice backed by the technician's typed assigned-job
projection, including its offline cache. The expense owner still revalidates
the selected work order when the request is submitted.

## Owners and boundaries

- `ui.work_order_expense_projection` owns the typed form, field errors,
  requester-owned claim list, category help, action eligibility, and honest ERP
  delivery labels.
- `operations.expense_categories` owns the live ERP category observation,
  including receipt requirements and per-claim maximums. Unavailable and empty
  are distinct and both disable submission.
- `operations.expense_requests` owns validation and the atomic submitted claim,
  line items, requester evidence, the selected approver link, the masked
  per-expense payment-destination snapshot, idempotency fingerprint, receipt
  metadata, work-order assignment eligibility, activity mark, and ordered ERP
  lifecycle consequences. It rejects submission when the work order is
  inactive, unauthorized, unknown, or has no assigned technician. Submission
  atomically stages `expense_submit_v3`.
- The admin route parses HTTP form and file values, enforces CSRF and the exact
  work-order read RBAC scope, releases its read transaction, and invokes
  the typed owner command. It does not commit or call ERP.
- Sub is authoritative for the Field manager's approval or rejection decision.
  The submitter selects one eligible approver from ERP; Sub maps that employee
  to one active SystemUser by normalized email, excludes the requester from the
  offered choices, and only that selected user may approve or reject. The
  submission owner independently rejects a requester selected as approver, and
  the approval owner re-resolves exact persisted requester identity and refuses
  self-approval before changing state or staging ERP delivery. ERP accepts that
  trusted, evidenced decision without constructing a second approval chain.
  ERP remains authoritative for approver eligibility,
  its bank directory, account-name verification, reimbursement bank details,
  payment intent state, transfer execution, reconciliation, and the final paid
  fact. Cost-centre, ERP task, fleet vehicle, and receipt-number controls remain
  out of scope.

  Approval has two explicit paths. **Approve as submitted** copies every
  immutable technician-requested line amount into the approved amount and does
  not require a reason. **Adjust and approve** accepts one positive approved
  amount for every existing line and requires a bounded reason when any amount
  differs. It cannot add, remove, recategorize, or otherwise rewrite a submitted
  line. The owner locks the request, checks its revision and selected approver,
  validates current category limits, writes all approved amounts, records the
  decision, changes lifecycle state, and stages ERP delivery in one transaction.

The Field app offers the technician's masked ERP bank profile by default. A
technician may instead enter an ERP bank and account number for this expense
only. For both modes, Sub asks ERP to resolve the account before submission,
shows a loading state, and displays the bank-returned account name in a
read-only field. Changing the mode, bank, or account number clears that result
and requires fresh verification. Sub receives an encrypted, short-lived token
bound to the requester, organization, and claim UUID, and persists and delivers
only that opaque token, bank label, account last four digits, bank-returned
beneficiary, and verification timestamps; it never stores the raw account
number. The employee's HR/display name is not an account-verification input.
ERP encrypts the verified account snapshot on the claim. Approval locks the
snapshot, and payment rejects any attempt to replace it. The override never
updates the employee's ERP profile.

The mobile-generated client reference is the canonical claim UUID. New
submissions persist that same UUID as both `FieldExpenseRequest.id` and
`client_ref`; destination verification and inspection, approved draft creation,
receipt delivery, ERP approval, delivery/payment idempotency keys, and status
polling all use `FieldExpenseRequest.id`. Before changing approval state or
staging delivery, the expense owner rejects a token-bearing historical request
whose `client_ref` differs from its primary key. The transaction rolls back and
leaves it submitted for a separate typed, audited repair decision.

Receipt bytes use the existing private attachment storage owner. Metadata is
staged flush-only inside the expense command transaction. A deterministic
per-line receipt client reference makes a repeated claim submission safe. The
existing general field receipt endpoint remains assigned-technician scoped.
Staff uploader identity is recorded on `FieldAttachment`; the legacy
subscriber-only `StoredFile.uploaded_by` field remains empty for these staff
uploads.

The reusable disclosure control is a semantic button with `aria-controls` and
synchronized `aria-expanded`. Activation opens the existing `details`, scrolls
the form into view, and focuses Purpose. Native `summary` mouse and keyboard
behavior remains available; permission-denied users receive a disabled button
and no submit surface.

## State and delivery semantics

The work-order card shows only claims created by the authenticated staff
identity. Local submission, ERP delivery, manager decision, and payment facts
remain distinct. A technician sees **Submitting to ERP** while the durable
submission is pending or sent, **Submitted** only after ERP acceptance, and
**Submission failed** with a requester-owned retry action when the durable
submission is dead. Connector internals and ERP draft details are not exposed.
Administrative projections may distinguish **Sending to ERP**, **Submitted to
ERP**, **Approval syncing**, **Approved**, **Rejected**, and **ERP delivery
failed**. `sent` outbox evidence is never presented as ERP acceptance.

Rejected and dead release events persist only the allowlisted integration
diagnostic code, HTTP status, and ERP request identifier alongside any existing
partial-delivery progress. Provider response text and validation input are not
persisted or displayed. Web and Field API projections render their explanation
from that typed diagnostic evidence; malformed or legacy evidence falls back to
a generic failure message.

Submission releases an ERP `SUBMITTED` claim. `expense_submit_v3` creates or
retrieves an idempotent hidden ERP draft, maps stable Sub line IDs to ERP items,
streams each private receipt from storage, uploads only missing attachments, and
invokes explicit ERP submission. The draft is invisible to normal ERP users and
becomes visible only after ERP returns `SUBMITTED`. Receipt bytes/base64 never
enter the database outbox; supported URL receipts remain claim-line data.
An explicit requester retry revalidates current receipt evidence and requeues
the same dead `expense_submit_v3` event with its original idempotency key. It
does not create another request or ERP claim.

Sub remains authoritative for the manager decision. Approval and rejection
stage separate `expense_approve_v4` and `expense_reject_v3` consequences ordered
after accepted submission. A decision that arrives first remains pending without
consuming delivery attempts. ERP remains authoritative for accounting, payment,
reconciliation, and paid status. Payment waits for accepted approval.
The v4 approval contains every stable source-line ID and approved amount. ERP
updates the submitted draft lines and approves them atomically. Historical
queued v3 approvals remain deliverable, but new approvals never use v3.

For every new request, destination verification `source_claim_id`, `client_ref`,
`FieldExpenseRequest.id`, ERP `source_claim_id`, and polling `source_claim_id`
are the same UUID. Token-bearing historical mismatches fail closed; this change
does not rekey or backfill historical rows.
Managers with the exact `operations:expense_request:pay` permission may stage a
payment command for an approved expense. The Field app never calls Paystack or
marks the claim paid. ERP creates and initiates the transfer, and Sub projects
`queued`, `pending`, `processing`, `indeterminate`, `failed`, `completed`, and
the resulting `paid` claim fact from ERP responses and polling.
`initiate_payment` is delivered only through the typed ERP payment
command/outcome capability. The generic path sender is not a payment transport.
Until ERP accepts that command, Field labels the local state as queued and
waiting for ERP. Rejected and dead payment deliveries retain only allowlisted
diagnostic evidence and never imply that a transfer was attempted.

Verification requires a live connection and expires after 30 minutes. Mobile
may save the ordinary non-sensitive draft, but it must not persist raw account
details, the destination token, or queue a verified submission for later
offline replay. An identical retry of an already-created request remains
idempotent after token expiry.

The field app's expense list follows the same requester-owned rule. Ownership
is resolved from any exact technician-profile, canonical Person Party, or
authenticated SystemUser link on the claim. Work-order completion or
reassignment does not remove the claim from the requester's history, and a
claim created by another staff identity is not exposed. Reading history does
not require a current active technician profile: the resolver starts from the
authenticated SystemUser and includes its canonical Person Party plus every
exact historically linked technician profile. Submission retains its separate
active-profile and assigned-work-order checks. List responses report the full
filtered count before pagination.

For a manager who is also a technician, the Field Expenses destination exposes
`My request`, `Pending`, and `History`. Pending remains the
default operational view, History contains resolved manager expenses and links
each item to its detailed projection, and the requester-owned tab uses the same
history resolver as every other field technician; manager capability never
hides personal history.
The manager approval list uses a typed owner query and labels every card
`Raised by` with the requester display identity resolved by
`auth.staff_provisioning`. A historical row without exact SystemUser identity
is resolved only when its persisted technician or Person link yields one exact
SystemUser; otherwise it is labelled unavailable. The client never infers a
requester from the current work-order assignment. The manager navigation does
not expose the Materials destination.
Both the Field app and the admin work-order detail retain a primary **Approve**
action for an unchanged request and a secondary **Adjust amount** action. The
latter opens line-level amount inputs and ends with **Approve adjusted amount**.
Technician and manager history show requested and approved totals plus the
adjustment reason when they differ.

## Schema change

Revision `594_field_expense_destination` adds nullable selected-approver,
masked destination, opaque token, verification, expiry, and lock evidence so
existing claims remain readable during rollout. `requested_by_technician_id` on expense requests and
`uploaded_by_technician_id` on field attachments become nullable. System-user
and person identity remain mandatory for new web submissions. The downgrade
fails closed while any staff-created rows without technician links exist.

Revision `617_expense_approval_adjustments` adds nullable per-line approved
amounts, approving-user and decision identity, adjustment reason, and a request
revision. Existing approved and paid lines are backfilled with their requested
amount so historical reimbursement and project-cost totals do not change.

## Validation and recovery

The server requires an eligible selected approver who is not the requester, a
valid ERP destination token, purpose, claim date, a three-letter currency, and
one to 50 positive-amount lines. Each line requires an active ERP category and a
description of at most 500 characters. A receipt URL and receipt upload are
individually optional alternatives; when the selected ERP category requires
receipt evidence, either one satisfies that rule. The browser never marks the
file input itself as required. It changes the shared Receipt marker and help
text when the category changes, then validates the URL-or-file choice as one
requirement. Category receipt and maximum rules are enforced again by the
command owner. Browser calculations and required markers are assistance only.
Approval accepts either no line overrides (approve as submitted) or exactly one
approved amount for every submitted line. Partial, duplicate, stale, zero, or
negative adjustments fail closed. A reason is required only when at least one
approved amount differs from its requested amount.

Private attachments must be active, owned by the same authoritative work order,
present in storage, within the receipt size limit, and have a supported MIME,
consistent size, and matching stored checksum. Receipt URLs must use a supported
HTTP(S) shape and cannot contain credentials, fragments, localhost, or literal
private-network addresses. Approval revalidates current category and receipt
evidence before staging delivery.

Non-sensitive text values and the stable claim client reference survive
validation errors.
Browsers cannot repopulate file inputs, so a selected receipt is cleared and an
explicit field error asks the user to reselect it. ERP category or sync
unavailability never fabricates a usable fallback. The account number is also
cleared and must be re-entered after an error.

A dead legacy approval-release event may be recovered only through a typed preview and
explicit recovery command. The owner revalidates approval, work order, category,
receipt, and ERP state, refuses ambiguity or a stale preview, preserves the
original event, and appends linked replacement evidence using a versioned key.
No automatic historical backfill or replay exists; legacy pre-approval events
are left untouched and refused by the worker.

Alembic revision `587_field_request_requester_history` repairs older claims
whose durable SystemUser link can be proven from their technician profile,
legacy SystemUser-as-person identifier, or unique Person Party binding. It also
adds requester lookup indexes. Ambiguous claims remain unchanged and hidden;
the repair never changes approval, delivery, or payment state and never queues
an ERP claim. `operations.expense_requests` owns this bounded, idempotent
repair, with Alembic acting only as its deployment adapter.

## Non-goals

This slice does not add a second persistence model, update the employee's ERP
bank profile, expose full stored bank credentials, automatically retry indeterminate
transfers, historical claim backfill, or production cutover changes.
