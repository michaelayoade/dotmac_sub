# Payment channels and collection accounts — source-of-truth consolidation

Status: accepted architecture; A1 implemented locally on
`feat/payment-channel-collection-account-sot`, pending PostgreSQL/CI and deployed
cutover verification, 2026-07-20.
Owner: `financial.collection_accounts`.

Revision note: an earlier draft treated this as one linear project and assumed the
customer-facing payment path ran on `payment_channels`. **It does not.** A deeper
review found two unconnected subsystems and four copies of the company bank
account. This revision splits the work accordingly. See "Architecture constraint".

## Problem

"Which Dotmac bank account received this money?" is unanswerable, because the
account shown to a customer is **not an entity** — it is a dict parsed out of a
JSON settings string. There is no identity to record on the payment.

**Four copies of the same fact — the company's receiving bank account:**

| # | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `billing.direct_bank_transfer_accounts` (JSON string in `domain_settings`) | **Frozen rollback snapshot** — 2 Zenith accounts, full numbers; no runtime reader or writer after A1 |
| 2 | `billing.direct_bank_transfer_bank_name` / `_account_name` / `_account_number` / `_sort_code` | Legacy singular settings, same fact |
| 3 | `company_bank_name` / `company_bank_account` (`web_system_company_info`) | Fallback branch of `invoice_bank_details.get_invoice_bank_details()` |
| 4 | `collection_accounts` table | **Owner** — production identities are seeded; A1 adds full presentment details |

`invoice_bank_details.py`'s docstring calls copy 1 "the source of truth", so the
drift is written down as if it were the design.

**And the attribution chain breaks at every hop:**

| Concern | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Channel of a payment | `payments.payment_channel_id` | Production backfill complete for all evidence-supported rows |
| Account of a payment | `payments.collection_account_id` | Populated only where evidence names a specific destination |
| Account a customer chose | `payment_proofs` | free-text `bank_name` only (301 rows) |

Note `direct_bank_transfer_enabled` is a **policy toggle, not a duplicated fact**.
It is legitimate configuration and is out of scope for deduplication.

## Architecture constraint — two subsystems that must stay separate

**Presentment — "how can this customer pay right now?"**

- Online gateways: `payment_routing.eligible_routes()` → `get_routing_policy()`
  (primary/secondary) filtered by live `provider_health()`.
- Direct bank transfer: appended by `_topup_payment_options()` when enabled, with
  accounts read from `financial.collection_accounts` through the owner reader.
- Consumers: customer portal top-up, reseller portal (`web_reseller_billing.py:81`),
  `api/me.py:703`.

**Attribution — "where did this money land?"**

- `payment_channels` + `collection_accounts` + `payment_channel_accounts`, via
  `_resolve_payment_channel` / `_resolve_collection_account`, on payment
  create/edit and consolidated payments.

**These two never touch.** The customer-facing path does not consult
`payment_channels` at all — which is the real reason the table was empty. Nothing
on the presentment path was ever meant to populate it.

> **Rule: do NOT route presentment through `payment_channels`.** Gateway
> presentment stays with `payment_routing`, which is health-aware and
> policy-ordered. Channels have neither and would be a downgrade. Channels remain
> the classification dimension for *recorded* payments and reporting.

What the two subsystems legitimately share is the **bank account identity**. That
is the seam, and unifying it is what makes per-account reconciliation possible.

## Principles

1. `collection_accounts` is the **single owner** of "a Dotmac bank account".
   Copies 1–3 are **retired, not mirrored**. During A1 deployment, their stored
   rows remain briefly as a frozen rollback snapshot with no runtime writer or
   reader. They are deleted after verification; they are never a live fallback.
2. One channel, many accounts. The fan-out lives in `payment_channel_accounts`.
   **Never create one channel per bank.**
3. A payment records both its channel and its collection account. Reconciliation
   reads columns, never memo strings.
4. Backfill asserts an account only where source evidence names one. Ambiguous
   rows stay NULL — a wrong account is worse than a missing one.
5. Sub carries accounting **mapping codes**, never a ledger (see below).

## Decisions

- **D1 — accepted.** Copies 1–3 are deleted in the contract phase after deployed
  verification. Until then they are a frozen rollback snapshot, not an alternate
  authority.
- **D2 — accepted.** Sub carries nullable `accounting_code` mappings and has no
  chart of accounts or runtime dependency on dotmac_erp.
- **D3.** Confirm the account list in B1 is complete, and which accounts are open
  for new payments versus historic-only. Full account numbers exist today only for
  the two Zenith accounts.

# Workstream A — Bank account consolidation

Well-bounded, high value, and the prerequisite for invoice display, customer
routing and per-account reconciliation. Independent of workstream B.

## A1 — Make `collection_accounts` the owner

1. Migration: add `account_number`, `account_name`, `sort_code`, nullable
   `accounting_code`, and explicit `presentment_priority` to
   `collection_accounts`. Add `accounting_code` to `payment_channels`.
2. Migrate the two live Zenith accounts out of copy 1 into the table.
3. Repoint every consumer at the owner (blast radius, ~8 sites):
   - `customer_portal_flow_payments`: `enabled_direct_bank_transfer_accounts`,
     `direct_bank_transfer_accounts`, `direct_bank_transfer_settings`, and the
     options builder
   - `web_reseller_billing.py:81`
   - `api/me.py:703`
   - `invoice_bank_details.get_invoice_bank_details()` — and **delete its
     company-info fallback** (copy 3)
   - `billing_invoice_pdf.py` (3 call sites), `web_billing_invoices.py:747`
   - `web_system_config.py` + admin `system.py` settings UI → point staff at the
     existing collection-accounts CRUD instead
4. Expand/contract rollout: stop every runtime read/write of settings copies 1–3,
   retain the rows/specs only through the verification window, then delete them.
   Keep `direct_bank_transfer_enabled` and `_instructions` — policy and copy, not
   duplicated bank-account facts.
5. Architecture test: nothing outside the collection-account owner reads
   `direct_bank_transfer_accounts` or the company-info bank fields, and sub defines
   no chart-of-accounts model.

### A1 cutover gates

1. Migration fails closed on invalid JSON, incomplete facts, duplicate legacy
   identities, or ambiguous last-four matches. It enriches the existing
   Splynx-backed identity where unique and inserts a deterministic owner row where
   no identity exists.
2. Every migrated live account has `bank_name`, `account_name`, `account_number`,
   derived `account_last4`, currency, active state, and explicit presentment order.
3. Portal, reseller portal, `/api/me`, invoice web view, and new invoice renders
   show the owner-backed accounts. Archived invoice exports remain unchanged.
4. Do not edit collection-account payment details during the rollback soak: old
   code can read only the frozen snapshot. After verification, remove the snapshot
   and its specs in the immediate contract change.

**Invoice PDF risk is low.** PDFs are archived (`InvoicePdfExport`,
`get_latest_export`), so historical documents are stable artifacts and only new
renders pick up the changed source. Confirm re-render behaviour before cutover.

Never store customer payment credentials here. These are Dotmac's own receiving
accounts, which the business publishes.

## A2 — Customer-type routing

`_resolve_collection_account(db, channel, currency, collection_account_id)` never
sees the subscriber, so segment routing is impossible today.

1. Promote `SubscriberCategory` from `metadata_` JSON to a real column —
   prerequisite for both routing and per-segment reporting.
2. Add a segment dimension to `payment_channel_accounts`.
3. Extend the resolver to accept the subscriber, preserving current behaviour when
   no segment-specific mapping exists.

`Subscriber.reseller_id` is already a column and can route without step 1.

## A3 — Invoice payment surface

Receipt upload is **already fully built for prepaid top-ups**: model
(`app/models/payment_proof.py`), API (`app/api/payment_proofs.py`), admin review
(`billing_payment_proofs.py`), customer flow (`/portal/billing/topup/transfer`),
templates, and 301 proofs in production. Invoices already print *one* bank account
via `invoice_bank_details`, but `invoice.html` offers only a bare "Pay" link and
`pay.html` is Paystack-only — no channel choice, no receipt upload.

Work: extend the invoice view with a channel choice; for Bank Transfer, render the
applicable accounts from `collection_accounts` and reuse the existing proof upload
scoped to an invoice rather than to account credit. New surface over existing
machinery, not new machinery.

# Workstream B — Channel attribution

Independent of workstream A. The seeded channels and the Splynx backfill evidence
need none of the presentment work.

## B1 — Complete the channel and account seed

The 2026-07-20 seed created four channels (Paystack, Flutterwave, Bank Transfer,
Cash). The authoritative Splynx `payments_types` list shows it is **incomplete**.

**Channels** (`payment_channels`)

| Channel | type | provider | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paystack | other | paystack | seeded |
| Flutterwave | other | flutterwave | seeded |
| Bank Transfer | bank_transfer | — | seeded; fans out to accounts below |
| Cash | cash | — | seeded |
| Remita | other | — | **add**; no provider record yet |
| Card | card | — | **add**; Splynx "Credit card" |
| Other | other | — | **add**; explicit catch-all, not a silent NULL |

**Collection accounts** (`collection_accounts`)

| Account | type | currency | Splynx label |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zenith …6461 | bank | NGN | `Zenith 461 Bank` |
| Zenith …9523 | bank | NGN | `Zenith 523 Bank` |
| UBA | bank | NGN | `UBA` |
| Dotmac USD | bank | USD | `Dotmac USD` |
| Cash — CBD | cash | NGN | `Cash CBD` |
| Cash — general | cash | NGN | `Cash` |

Map accounts to channels via `payment_channel_accounts`, using its `currency`
column for the USD account so `_resolve_collection_account` selects it correctly.

**Resolver hazard:** `_resolve_payment_channel` raises HTTP 400 ("Multiple payment
channels match provider; set a default") when a provider has more than one active
channel and none is default. Keep exactly one channel per provider, explicitly
defaulted. `is_default` is scoped per provider, so defaults across providers do not
collide.

## B2 — Close the attribution chain

1. Add a collection-account reference to `payment_proofs` (the customer already
   selects one; the template posts `account.id`, it is simply not persisted).
2. Carry it through proof verification to `Payment.collection_account_id`.
3. Ensure every payment-creating path sets channel and account, including the
   Paystack webhook (channel resolves from `provider_id` today) and manual admin
   capture.
4. Test: a verified bank-transfer proof produces a payment whose channel is Bank
   Transfer and whose collection account is the one the customer chose.

## B3 — Backfill history from Splynx

**Migration completeness verified 2026-07-20:** the Splynx `payments` table holds
**98,417 rows** (AUTO_INCREMENT 98,418), counted directly from the seabone dump;
production carries **exactly 98,417** payments with a `splynx_payment_id`. No
payments were lost. The remaining 764 of 99,181 are native.

Evidence available on production: `splynx_billing_transactions` 232,377 rows,
`splynx_id_mappings` 240,027. **98,413 of the 98,417 join** — 4 payments carry a
Splynx id with no evidence row and must fall back to native evidence or stay NULL.

`category_name` is uniformly "Payment" and carries nothing, but `description` is a
closed set naming **both channel and specific account** (these are
`payments_types.name`, so the mapping is authoritative, not inferred):

| Splynx description | n | amount | → channel | → account |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Paystack | 64,562 | 1,755,971,060.78 | Paystack | — |
| Zenith 461 Bank | 25,938 | 1,627,886,648.31 | Bank Transfer | Zenith …6461 |
| Bank transfer | 2,458 | 319,751,040.07 | Bank Transfer | *(unnamed — leave NULL)* |
| Zenith 523 Bank | 1,838 | 407,930,579.24 | Bank Transfer | Zenith …9523 |
| Other | 1,308 | 37,692,686.75 | Other | — |
| Cash CBD | 1,193 | 55,286,385.00 | Cash | Cash — CBD |
| Flutterwave | 669 | 15,354,488.00 | Flutterwave | — |
| Cash | 338 | 17,116,133.87 | Cash | Cash — general |
| Credit card | 75 | 7,329,625.03 | Card | — |
| Dotmac USD | 16 | 10,679,738.08 | Bank Transfer | Dotmac USD (USD) |
| UBA | 16 | 917,500.00 | Bank Transfer | UBA |
| Remita | 2 | 417,000.00 | Remita | — |

Channel derivable for **100%** of joined rows; account for **29,299**. The 2,458
generic "Bank transfer" rows get a channel but **no account** — the honest outcome,
not a defect to paper over.

The 764 native payments backfill from native evidence: `provider_id` where set
(217 rows), else memo prefixes (`Paystack prepaid top-up ref: DMAC-`,
`Bank transfer (proof …)`, `NIP/FBN/…`, `TRF FROM …`); 453 of 668 post-cutover
payments carry an `external_id`.

Execution: one-off script, dry-run by default, emitting a per-bucket diff and an
explicit unmatched count. Never overwrite a non-NULL channel or account.

## B4 — Reports and filters

Only meaningful after B1 and B3, or reports show channels with no volume.

- Payments by channel, and by collection account, over a period.
- Per-account reconciliation against bank statements; per-gateway against
  settlement reports once `fee_rules` and accounts are populated.
- Gross versus settled once fees are modelled.
- Channel and account as filter facets on the payments list, following the existing
  list-projection pattern.
- `reporting.py:827` already outer-joins `PaymentChannel` but groups by
  `method_key`; replace with a real channel dimension.

# Accounting-integration scope (app-independent)

Sub and ERP are **separate applications**. Sub must not depend on ERP, and must not
grow a general ledger of its own. The goal is narrower: carry just enough stable
reference data that **any** accounting app — QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, Zoho, or
dotmac_erp — can be integrated later without reshaping billing.

**In scope for sub**

- A nullable `accounting_code` on the objects an accounting export must classify:
  `collection_accounts` (where money landed) and `payment_channels` (how it
  arrived). Free-form string, owned as configuration, meaningful only to the
  external system.
- The same treatment for revenue/receivable classification, reusing the existing
  `LedgerCategory` rather than inventing a parallel taxonomy.
- Editable through the existing admin CRUD; exposed on the payment/collection read
  models so an exporter can consume it.

**Explicitly out of scope for sub**

- Chart of accounts, account categories, account balances.
- Journals, journal entries, GL postings, trial balance.
- Bank accounts as financial entities, and any FK or runtime call into ERP.

**Precedent:** Splynx did exactly this — `payments_types` (operational channel)
referenced `accounting_bank_accounts`, a thin table of `accounting_id` + `name`
(`Zenith 461 Bank` → `397`, `Zenith 523 Bank` → `395`, `Paystack` → `398`,
`Cash CBD` → `342`, `Undeposited Funds` → `425`). Those are QuickBooks GL codes
held as *mapping*, not as a ledger. Splynx modelled no accounts, journals or
balances and still integrated Xero, SageOne and QuickBooks. Those existing codes
are a ready-made seed for the mapping.

If more than one accounting system must be supported simultaneously, promote
`accounting_code` to a small mapping table keyed by (entity, system, code). Start
with the single field; add the table only when a second system actually exists.

# Sequencing

**A1 first** — it collapses four authorities into one and is what makes everything
downstream possible. A2 and A3 follow it.

**Workstream B runs in parallel.** B1 and B3 depend only on each other, not on A.
B2 is the join point: it needs A1's owned accounts to reference.

B4 last — reporting before backfill shows empty channels. A2 needs the
`SubscriberCategory` column promotion first, or it encodes segment logic against a
JSON field.
