# Vendor supply UI

## Scope

This slice exposes the existing vendor material-release and mobilisation-advance
domains in the vendor project workspace and the staff vendor-operations queue.
It does not add inventory, warehouse, payment, settlement, or invoice-netting
authority to Sub.

## Ownership

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Material request eligibility, release decision, and provider issue observation | `operations.vendor_material_release` |
| Advance eligibility, quote ceiling, approval, and payables observation | `operations.vendor_advances` |
| Atomic vendor request command | `operations.vendor_project_workspace` |
| Typed vendor/staff read projection and exact review preview | `ui.vendor_supply_projection` |
| Signed, stale-safe staff review confirmation and replay guard | `operations.vendor_supply_review_confirmation` |
| Labels, tones, and icons | `ui.status_presentation` |
| Vendor and staff capabilities | `auth.permission_gate` |

Routes and templates are adapters. They authorize, validate transport values,
render typed projections, and map domain errors. They do not decide eligibility,
infer provider outcomes, or commit participant writes.

## Vendor workspace contract

The project detail page presents two independent panels:

- Materials: request eligibility, requested lines, Dotmac review state, review
  note, and the separately timestamped provider issue observation.
- Mobilisation advance: approved quote total, configured ceiling, already
  committed amount, remaining allowance, Dotmac review state, and the separately
  timestamped payables observation.

`vendor:material:request` is available to vendor owners and supervisors.
`vendor:advance:request` is owner-only. The UI renders the owner-supplied blocked
reason when project, assignment, quote, allowance, lifecycle, or capability
rules prevent a request. Commands repeat those rules inside the authoritative
transaction.

Absent provider state is explicit:

- `not_applicable` before Dotmac approval or after rejection/cancellation;
- `unknown` after approval when no provider outcome has been observed;
- `present` with an observation timestamp when a provider status exists.

Dotmac approval never renders as material issued or money paid.

## Staff review contract

The vendor operations queue separates inventory and accounts-payable authority:

- material rows require `inventory:read` to view and `inventory:write` to act;
- advance rows require `finance:ap:read` to view and `finance:ap:write` to act.
- staff reach those rows through the `materials` and `advances` queue filters
  on `/admin/vendors/operations`; the active filter and search query are kept
  in the URL so refresh and shared links preserve the selected work.

Approve, reject, material issue, and advance disbursement are important
actions. Material issue is available only after Dotmac approval. Staff use one
form to choose `dotmac_store` or `erp`, optionally enter the issue reference,
enter issued quantities for the approved lines, and confirm. Each action first
issues a ten-minute signed preview bound to the staff actor, record, action,
reason or issue input, and exact state fingerprint. Confirmation:

1. opens one owner-command transaction;
2. locks the material release or advance;
3. recomputes the preview and fails on drift;
4. reserves the signed proposal identifier for replay safety;
5. invokes the declaring participant owner once;
6. stores stable result evidence and commits atomically.

Rejection requires a reason. Approval may carry an optional note. A changed
status, release line, issue source, issue reference, issued quantity, amount,
quote allowance, committed total, vendor/project binding, or review reason
invalidates the preview.

## Freshness, drift, and repair

Material provider and payables data are observations, not decisions. Present
observations carry their provider-observed timestamp. The last good observation
is retained when refresh fails and must be labelled stale by the standard
`StateValue` contract when its freshness window is exceeded.

Drift signals are:

- an approved release without a later support observation;
- an approved advance without a later payables observation;
- a provider report that differs from the stored reference/status/timestamp.

Repair remains with the configured integration adapter, which reapplies the
current provider outcome through `apply_provider_outcome` or
`apply_payables_observation`. Rebuilding the UI projection is idempotent and
does not mutate authoritative state.

## Validation

Focused tests cover eligibility parity, typed projections, observation
semantics, role and staff permissions, signed preview/confirmation, stale
rejection, replay, rollback, templates, and architecture boundaries. The
repository-prescribed lint, typing, architecture, unit, integration, and
browser checks remain required before publication.
