# Installed BEFORE the revision map is built. A composed module's migration

# loudly here rather than ordering wrongly. See `app/migration_bindings.py`.

# --- composed module lineages -------------------------------------------
#
# Each composed module ships its own Alembic revisions inside its installed
# distribution and tells us where they are. Appending them here rather than
# naming a path in `alembic.ini` keeps the config free of the venv layout and
# the Python version, which differ between a developer checkout, the container
# and CI.
#
# The lineages are APPENDED after Sub's own, which stays first because it
# supplies the prerequisite effects every module requires — see
# `app/migration_bindings.py` for which revision supplies which effect.
#
# A module absent from the environment is a composition error, not something to
# skip: the pin in `pyproject.toml` says it is installed, and continuing without
# its lineage would run `alembic upgrade heads` against a database missing that
# module's schema while reporting success.
