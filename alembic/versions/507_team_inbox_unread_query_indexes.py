"""Add covering indexes for grouped Team Inbox unread reads.

The unread cohort is derived from timestamped inbound messages and one
operator's monotonic conversation cursor. PostgreSQL builds both indexes
concurrently so the message chronology remains writable during the expand
step. The set-based query is compatible before, during, and after either build.
