"""Add a DB-level unique constraint on offer_versions(offer_id, version_number).

Before this migration, uniqueness of ``version_number`` within one offer was
enforced ONLY in application code: an advisory lock plus a pre-insert
existence check inside
``app.services.catalog.offer_access_requirement.admit_offer_version``. A
caller that bypassed that owner command entirely (or a code path added later
that writes ``OfferVersion`` rows directly) had no database-level backstop at
all -- this migration adds one.

This migration is authored only and deliberately NOT applied against any
database as part of this change. It is expected to be able to FAIL against
a database that already holds duplicate (offer_id, version_number) pairs
(pre-existing dirty data) -- that is correct, intended behavior: surfacing a
real data problem loudly at migration time is preferable to silently
omitting the constraint because dirty data might exist. Any such failure
must be repaired (de-duplicate or re-number the conflicting rows) before this
migration can apply; that repair is out of scope here.
