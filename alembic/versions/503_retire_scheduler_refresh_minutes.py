"""Retire the dead scheduler.refresh_minutes control

`scheduler.refresh_minutes` had a spec, a seed row and an entry in the settings
API's private key set — and no reader anywhere. It survived
`tests/architecture/test_no_orphan_settings.py` only because that guard counts a
quoted key literal anywhere under `app/`, and the API's `_SCHEDULER_SETTING_KEYS`
supplied one. Removing that private key set is what exposed it.

The spec and seed are gone; this deletes the stored row so an operator cannot
edit a control that changes nothing. `scheduler.beat_refresh_seconds` is the
live control and is untouched.
