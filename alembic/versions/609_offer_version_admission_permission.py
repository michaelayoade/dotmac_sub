"""Register catalog:offer_version:admission. Not seeded into any role.

Idempotent: reruns update the existing row rather than duplicating it. This
mirrors 608_offer_access_requirement_classify_permission's exact pattern:
this migration seeds the permission row only.

Admission authorization is checked at TWO independent layers: the route
layer (``app/api/catalog.py``) AND a fresh, in-transaction re-check inside
``service_intent.offer_access_requirement``'s own command
(``verify_admission_authorization``) — see that module's docstring. The
route ALSO sits under this router's own
``catalog:write`` gate (``require_method_permission("catalog:read",
"catalog:write")``, applied to every mutating route in that file, unrelated
to and pre-dating this permission), so the actual effective requirement is
``catalog:write AND (catalog:billing_write OR
catalog:offer_version:admission)`` -- never a pure OR/standalone-narrower-
permission alternative. A caller holding the existing ``catalog:billing_write``
continues to admit an offer version exactly as before, and this permission is
a genuine, narrower, OPT-IN future delegation path, not a hard requirement
layered on top of existing access. There is therefore nothing to copy from
``catalog:billing_write``'s existing grants: no role loses or gains admission
ability as a side effect of this migration, so (unlike an earlier version of
this migration) there is no grant-copying logic here, and no risk of an
incomplete copy regressing an API-key or direct-permission-grant principal.
