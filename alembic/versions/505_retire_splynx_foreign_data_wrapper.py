"""Retire the foreign-data wrapper onto the former billing system.

Production carries a ``splynx_fdw`` schema of 26 foreign tables against a
``splynx_server`` pointing at 149.102.135.97:5435. The remote does not answer —
a select against it times out — and nothing references the schema anywhere in
the application, migrations, scripts or tests. Foreign tables hold no data of
their own, so removing them loses nothing; the data lived on the remote that is
gone.

None of it was ever created by a migration. It was hand-run DDL during the
migration era, which is why the objects exist in production and in no
environment built from this chain. Dropping it by hand would be a second
untracked change of exactly the kind that produced the drift, so the removal is
recorded here instead: any environment still carrying the residue is cleaned
when it upgrades, and one built from scratch is unaffected.

The user mapping is dropped with it, which also removes a stored credential for
a host that no longer exists.

Downgrade deliberately does not recreate any of this. Restoring a connection to
a decommissioned system is not a migration concern, and the remote is gone.
