"""Register catalog:offer_access_requirement:classify. Not seeded into any role.

Idempotent: reruns update the existing row rather than duplicating it. This
migration deliberately does NOT insert into role_permissions — the reviewed
classification CLI is the only intended caller, gated by a real staff
principal or a scoped machine credential (see
scripts/catalog/classify_offer_access_requirement.py). Normal wildcard/admin
RBAC access (``*`` or the ``admin`` role) continues to satisfy this permission
exactly as it does every other permission in this system; that is existing
RBAC behavior, not a grant this migration adds.
