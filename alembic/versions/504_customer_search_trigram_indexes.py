"""Add the missing trigram indexes for admin customer search.

The canonical customer-list search combines every searchable customer column
with ``OR`` predicates. Production already has trigram indexes for the other
text branches, but ``display_name`` and ``phone`` were left unindexed. Either
unindexed branch can make PostgreSQL choose a sequential scan for the combined
predicate, which is then paid twice for the page count and result query.

PostgreSQL builds these indexes concurrently so customer writes remain
available during deployment. The extension is part of the base schema.
