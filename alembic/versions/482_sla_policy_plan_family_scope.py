"""Add the plan_family scope to sla_policy_versions.

A commercial family (unlimited / dedicated / home_flex) can now carry its own
effective-dated SLA terms. The scope sits below ``offer_version`` and above
``internal_measurement`` in the resolver precedence: an offer that negotiates
its own terms still wins, and a family default outranks the internal
measurement statement.

Unlike the other scopes this one is a closed vocabulary rather than a foreign
key, so it is constrained by value in the database — a direct write cannot
introduce a family the resolver has no way to match.

Revision 467's exclusion and derived-key constraints predate the family scope
and COALESCE only the UUID scopes. Left untouched they would collapse every
family onto one 'global' exclusion key — so two families could not both hold an
active policy — and would derive every family key as ``plan_family:global``,
failing the derived-key CHECK on every family insert. Both are Postgres-only
(``EXCLUDE USING gist``), so a SQLite test lane cannot observe either. This
revision replaces both definitions.
