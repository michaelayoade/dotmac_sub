# Xcode Cloud post-clone hook for the dotmac_field technician app.
#
# Xcode Cloud clones the repo and runs `xcodebuild` on Runner.xcworkspace, but it
# has no knowledge of Flutter — the Flutter SDK, Generated.xcconfig, the Flutter
# framework, generated Dart (drift), and CocoaPods/SwiftPM deps are all absent, so
# the build fails. This script installs Flutter and generates those artifacts
# before Xcode Cloud's build step runs.
#
# Lives at mobile/ios/ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh — Xcode Cloud auto-runs any
# ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh adjacent to the Xcode project.

# Pin Flutter to the exact revision recorded in mobile/.metadata (version
# controlled, authoritative). Xcode Cloud disables automatic SwiftPM resolution,
# so the regenerated plugin package graph must match the committed
# Package.resolved — a floating "stable" can pull newer plugins and break
# resolution. Keeping this in lockstep with .metadata avoids a hardcoded version.

# --- FCM push (operator-gated) -------------------------------------------------
# GoogleService-Info.plist and the push capability are per-deployment and kept
# out of the repo. When the operator supplies the plist as a base64 Xcode Cloud
# secret, materialize it, switch the entitlement to the production APNs
# environment (this is a distribution/TestFlight build), and wire it into the
# Runner target. Without the secret the app builds normally with push disabled
# (FcmPushSource.tryCreate() returns null → NoopPushSource). Runs AFTER
# `flutter build` so Flutter's project regeneration can't clobber it.
